*This article was called out as a dependency needed for the "envision" content of the modernize methodology documentation. Alternative proposed filename was "establishing-cloud-horizons", but naming index.md for now since it's serving as the overview for "adopt", at least for the time being.*

# Establishing adoption horizons

**Key takeaway of this article**: Customers should minimize the amount of effort they spend working on multiple horizons at once. It will create complexity, additional work and slowdowns.

Customers are coming in with a whole variety of different adoption goals. We have content for "migrate, modernize and innovate".

This article is built around this visualization - an example of a three-horizon adoption plan for a customer:

Every cloud adoption plan generally has these three horizons, but for any given customer they may come in a different order.

Encourage the customer to *identify* which horizons best fit across their cloud adoption plan based on timing and needs and set those up as a way to use the "migrate, modernize, innovate" methodologies.

This may be a short article, with a table or brief narratives for each horizon. H2s for each horizon (migrate, modernize, innovate), plus one at the top for "Find the right horizon for you", and one at the end for "aligning the horizons" that explains that the customer will probably need all three, but the order varies.
