# Adopt the cloud

The adopt phase of the cloud adoption framework is where you start using the cloud. We show you how to migrate, modernize, and innovate in the cloud. You don't have to use all three. Pick the adoption paths that meet your immediate and long-term needs. The way you adopt the cloud depends your starting point and where you want to go (*see figure*).

Below is a brief overview of each way to adopt the cloud.

## Migrate overview

Migrate refers to moving your workloads to the cloud. There are different methods to migrating, such as rehost and replatform. But in this context, we're talking about rehosting, also known as the "lift-and-shift" approach. Basically, you trade an on-premises data center for cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions in the cloud. You don't have to worry about acquiring, managing, and securing hardware.

- *Example:* Migrate application from on-premises to IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Goals:* Exit the data center, enhance security, improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Trade your on-site capital expense for a pay-as-you-go model and adopt IaaS solutions.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance.

## Modernize overview

Modernize means enhancing existing applications with more cloud capabilities. The most common form of modernization is adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). The focus is enhancing business processes at scale.

- *Examples*: Move SQL database to Azure SQL database. Move a containerized application to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance, and operations.

## Innovate overview

Innovate is using data to create customer-focused solutions that transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Use data and applications to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.
