# Adopt the cloud

Your cloud adoption plan will take you down several paths or "horizons." Organizations follow three primary horizons: migrate, modernize, and innovate. The horizon you choose and when will depend your business goals (*see figure*). These horizons don't need to be followed in a sequence. We provide guidance to help you choose which horizon is best suited to your current needs. Most cloud adoption plans visit all three horizons. Your business goals will determine the best order.

## Overview of Adopt

You can jump to the guidance for each horizon using the buttons below. Below, you can find a brief overview of the horizon.

### Horizon 1: Migrate

The migrate horizon focuses on moving workloads to the cloud.

- *Goals:* Exit the data center business, adopt infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Trade your on-site capital expense for a pay-as-you-go model and adopt IaaS solutions.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, and availability.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can modernize while you migrate. See next steps.

### Horizon 2: Modernize

The modernize horizon focuses on enhancing business processes at scale.

- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Security, performance, and cost.

### Horizon 3: Innovate

The innovate horizon focuses on applying customer-focused solutions that transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Use data and applications to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.
