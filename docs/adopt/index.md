# Adopt the cloud

The adopt methodology is where you start benefiting from the cloud. You will learn how to use the cloud to meet your short-term and long-term business goals. Your goals will determine the approach you take to adopt the cloud. This series of article will guide to the right approach for your business. It will also give you concrete steps to adopting the cloud to your application portfolio.

There are three common approaches for adopting the cloud: migrate, modernize, and innovate. Each cloud adoption approach has different goals, solutions, and benefits (*see figure*).

## Migrate approach

The migrate approach is where you move your workloads from on-premises to the cloud. Different forms of migration exist, but we'll focus on rehosting, also known as "lift-and-shift." In this approach, you move from an on-premises solution and adopt infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions in the cloud.

- *Example:* Migrate application from on-premises to IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Goals:* Quickly exit on-premises, enhance security, and improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Adopt IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance. You don't have to worry about acquiring, managing, and securing hardware.

## Modernize approach

The modernize approach is where you enhance existing applications to improve operations, increase efficiency, maximize developer velocity, and reduce the total cost of ownership. Modernizing uses managed platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS) to improve your business at scale.

- *Examples*: Move to managed services. Move from SQL database to Azure SQL database. Containerize applications and migrate from virtual machines to Azure Kubernetes Service or Container Apps.
- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance, and operations. You don't have to managed the underlying infrastructure and can focus on scaling your business.

## Innovate approach

The innovate approach where you adopt cloud-native technologies to create customer-focused solutions that rapidly transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Adopt data and application capabilities to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.
