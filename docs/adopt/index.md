# Adopt the cloud

The adopt methodology is where you start seeing the benefits of the cloud. You will adopt cloud technologies that let you focus on building better solutions for your customers. You will introduce new processes and tools that streamline development and operations so you can rapidly meet customer needs.

This series of articles will help you tailor your cloud adoption approach around your goals. Your goals will be at the center of each decision. You will find concrete steps to follow that will help you adopt the cloud and transform your business.

There are three common approaches for adopting the cloud: migrate, modernize, and innovate. Each cloud adoption approach has different goals, solutions, and benefits (*see figure*).

## Migrate approach

The migrate approach is where you move your workloads from on-premises to the cloud. Different forms of migration exist, but we'll focus on rehosting, also known as "lift-and-shift." In this approach, you move from an on-premises solution and adopt infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions in the cloud.

- *Example:* Migrate application from on-premises to IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Goals:* Quickly exit on-premises, enhance security, and improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Adopt IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance. You don't have to worry about acquiring, managing, and securing hardware.

## Modernize approach

The modernize approach is where you enhance existing applications to improve operations, increase efficiency, maximize developer velocity, and reduce the total cost of ownership. Modernizing uses managed platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS) to improve your business at scale.

- *Examples*: Move to managed services. Move from SQL database to Azure SQL database. Containerize applications and migrate from virtual machines to Azure Kubernetes Service or Container Apps.
- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance, and operations. You don't have to managed the underlying infrastructure and can focus on scaling your business.

## Innovate approach

The innovate approach where you adopt cloud-native technologies to create customer-focused solutions that rapidly transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Adopt data and application capabilities to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.
