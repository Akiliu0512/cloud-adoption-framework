# Establishing cloud adoption horizons

Your cloud adoption plan will involve one or more horizons. Each horizon maps to different goals (*see figure*). Your business objectives will determine what horizon(s) to pursue and when.  You're likely going to visit all three horizons during your cloud adoption journey. Your cloud adoption plan can unfold in any order and doesn't need to follow the sequence. But make sure to tackle just one horizon at a time. Based on your goals, you can determine which sequence works best for you.

## [Horizon 1: Migrate](../migrate/index.md)

The goal of the migrate horizon is to move on-site workloads to the cloud.

- *Goals:* Exit the data center business, adopt infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Trade your on-site capital expense for a pay-as-you-go model and adopt IaaS solutions.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, and availability.

## [Horizon 2: Modernize](../modernize/index.md)

The goal of the modernize horizon is to enhance business processes at scale.

- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Security, performance, and cost.

## [Horizon 3: Innovate](../innovate/index.md)

The goal of the innovate horizon is to apply customer-focused solutions to transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Use data and applications to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Architecture, performance, and flexibility.
