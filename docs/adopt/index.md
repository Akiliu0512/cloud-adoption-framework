# Establish adoption horizons

The methodologies required for cloud adoption generally fall into three horizons: [Migrate](../migrate/index.md), [Modernize](../modernize/index.md), and [Innovate](../innovate/index.md). It's important to identify and prioritize which horizon sequence best fits across your cloud adoption plan, based on your adoption goals.

Use the following horizons to establish your organization's adoption plan. These horizons support cloud adoption efforts by capturing prioritized tasks. Your cloud adoption plan maps to the metrics and motivations defined in your [cloud adoption strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/cloud-adoption-strategy-evaluator).

## Find the right horizon for you

Determine which horizon best fits your adoption goals and which business motivations and workloads are important to address first. The following image shows an example of a three-horizon adoption plan.

It's a good idea to minimize the amount of effort that you spend on multiple horizons at once to limit complexity and unnecessary work and slowdowns. For more information, see [Application portfolio migration and modernization approach](migrate-modernize-approaches.md#application-portfolio-migration-and-modernization-approach)

## Migrate

[Migration](../migrate/index.md) is about moving your apps and data to more cloud-native platforms. Your migration workloads require cost, architecture, and tooling evaluation, replication of functionality, and review and handoff for governance, management, and security. Migration ultimately results in improved operations as you exit the data center business.

## Modernize

[Modernization](../modernize/index.md) involves improving the design and function of your existing apps and databases. Your data and application platform infrastructure get vastly improved with new features and technical capabilities, resulting in reduced technical debt.

## Innovate

[Innovation](../innovate/index.md) involves engaging with and getting feedback from your customers, creating new solutions, and then applying those solutions. Developing new data plays unlocks new technical skills, resulting in repositioned business and technical solutions to drive [business value](../innovate/business-value.md#what-is-business-value).

## Align horizons

Most likely, you're going to visit all three horizons during your cloud adoption journey. Based on your goals and priorities, you can determine which sequence works best for you. Do you want to [modernize or migrate first](migrate-modernize-approaches.md)? How will you [evaluate your modernization options](../modernize/evaluate-modernization-options.md)?
