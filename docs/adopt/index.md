<!--Acrolinx:100, TODO: meta description
This article was called out as a dependency needed for the "envision" content of the modernize methodology documentation. Alternative proposed filename was "establishing-cloud-horizons", but naming index.md for now since it's serving as the overview for "adopt", at least for the time being.*

# Establish adoption horizons

The methodologies required for cloud adoption generally fall into three *horizons*: [Migrate horizon](../migrate/index.md), [Modernize horizon](../modernize/index.md), and [Innovate horizon](../innovate/index.md). It's important to identify and prioritize which horizon sequence best fits across your cloud adoption plan, based on your adoption goals.

Use the following horizons to establish your organization's adoption plan. These horizons support cloud adoption efforts by capturing prioritized tasks. Your cloud adoption plan will map to the metrics and motivations defined in the cloud adoption strategy.

## Find the right horizon for you

Determine which horizon best fits your adoption goals and which business motivations and workloads are important to address first. The following image shows an example of a three-horizon adoption plan.

It's a good idea to minimize the amount of effort that you spend on multiple horizons at once to limit complexity and unnecessary work and slowdowns.

## Migrate

[Migrate](../migrate/index.md) your infrastructure and workloads, so you can improve operations as you exit the data center business.

## Modernize

Modernize and get more modern applications with new features and technical capabilities. For example, refactoring, rearchitecting, and rebuilding apps and databases reduce your technical debt.

## Innovate

Innovate by developing new data plays to drive [business value](../innovate/business-value.md#what-is-business-value). This methodology results in repositioned business and technical solutions for your business.

## Align horizons

You're probably going to need all three horizons, only in a sequence that works best for you.
