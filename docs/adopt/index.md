*This article was called out as a dependency needed for the "envision" content of the modernize methodology documentation. Alternative proposed filename was "establishing-cloud-horizons", but naming index.md for now since it's serving as the overview for "adopt", at least for the time being.*

# Establishing adoption horizons

The methodologies required for cloud adoption generally fall into three horizons: [Migrate](../../migrate/index.md), [Modernize](index.md), and [Innovate](../../innovate/index.md). It's important to *identify* and *prioritize* which horizons best fit across your cloud adoption plan, based on your adoption goals and timing.

## Find the right horizon for you

Determine which horizon best fits your adoption goals and which business motivations and workloads are important to address first. The following image shows an example of a three-horizon adoption plan.

> [!TIP]
> It's a great idea to minimize the amount of effort that you spend on multiple horizons at once to limit complexity and unnecessary work and slowdowns.

## Migrate

[Migrate](../migrate/index.md) your infrastructure and workloads, so you can improve operations as you exit the data center business.
where it fits, rough explanation

## Modernize

Modernization means that you have more modern applications with new features and technical capabilities. For example, refactoring, rearchitecting, and rebuilding apps and databases, which reduce your technical debt.

## Innovate

[Innovation](../innovate/index.md) involves developing new data plays to drive [business value](../../innovate/business-value.md#what-is-business-value). This effort results in repositioned business and technical solutions for your business.

## Align

You're probably going to need all three horizons, only in a sequence that works best for you.
