# Adopt the cloud

The adopt phase helps you incorporate  cloud capabilities that meet your needs. Your business goals will determine your specific cloud adoption plan.

There are three ways to adopt the cloud: migrate, modernize, and innovate. These three ways to adopt the cloud aren't mutually exclusive. You can use all three in your cloud adoption journey. Or you can just use one or two. The order and number of ways you adopt the cloud depends your starting point and your goals (*see figure*).

Below is an overview of each way to adopt the cloud.

## Migrate overview

Migrate refers to moving your workloads to the cloud. There are different methods to migrating, such as rehost and replatform. But in this context, we're talking about rehosting, also known as the "lift-and-shift" approach. Basically, you trade an on-premises data center for cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions in the cloud. You don't have to worry about acquiring, managing, and securing hardware.

- *Example:* Migrate application from on-premises to IaaS solutions in the cloud.
- *Goals:* Exit the data center, enhance security, improve operations.
- *Solutions:* Trade your on-site capital expense for a pay-as-you-go model and adopt IaaS solutions.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance.

You can modernize while you migrate. The next article walks you through the pros and cons of each.

## Modernize overview

Modernize means enhancing existing applications with more cloud capabilities. The most common form of modernization is adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). The focus is enhancing business processes at scale.

- *Examples*: Move SQL database to Azure SQL database. Move a containerized application to Azure Kubernetes Service.
- *Goals:* Reduce technical debt, modernize applications, and modernize data platforms
- *Solutions:* Adopt platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions across workload clusters.
- *Key Benefits:* Cost, security, availability, visibility, performance, and operations.

## Innovate overview

Innovate is using data to create customer-focused solutions that transform business outcomes.

- *Goals:* Reposition your business, reposition technical solutions, and find innovative data plays.
- *Solutions:* Use data and applications to empower adoption and build predictive tools.
- *Key Benefits:* Predictive analytics, performance, and adaptability.
