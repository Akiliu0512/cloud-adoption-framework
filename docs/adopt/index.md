**Key takeaway of this article**: Customers should minimize the amount of effort they spend working on multiple horizons at once. It will create complexity, additional work and slowdowns.
This article is built around this visualization - an example of a three-horizon adoption plan for a customer:

Every cloud adoption plan generally has these three horizons, but for any given customer they may come in a different order.

Encourage the customer .

This may be a short article, with a table or brief narratives for each horizon. H2s for each horizon (migrate, modernize, innovate), plus one at the top for "Find the right horizon for you", and one at the end for "aligning the horizons" that explains that the customer will probably need all three, but the order varies.

# Establishing adoption horizons

The methodologies required for cloud adoption generally fall into three horizons: [Migrate](../../migrate/index.md), [Modernize](index.md), and [Innovate](../../innovate/index.md). It's important to *identify* and *prioritize* which horizons best fit across your cloud adoption plan, based on your adoption goals and timing.

## Find the right horizon for you

Determine which horizon best fits your adoption goals and which business motivations and workloads are important to address first. The following image shows an example of a three-horizon adoption plan.

> [!TIP]
> It's a great idea to minimize the amount of effort that you spend on multiple horizons at once to limit complexity and unnecessary work and slowdowns.

## Migrate

[Migrate](../migrate/index.md) your infrastructure and workloads, so you can improve operations as you exit the data center business.
where it fits, rough explanation

## Modernize

Modernization means that you have more modern applications with new features and technical capabilities. For example, refactoring, rearchitecting, and rebuilding apps and databases, which reduces your technical debt.

## Innovate

[Innovation](../innovate/index.md) involves developing new data plays to drive [business value](../../innovate/business-value.md#what-is-business-value). This effort results in repositioned business and technical solutions for your business.

## Align

You're probably going to need all three horizons, only in a sequence that works best for you.
