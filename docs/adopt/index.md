# Establish adoption horizons

The methodologies required for cloud adoption generally fall into three horizons: [Migrate](../migrate/index.md), [Modernize](../modernize/index.md), and [Innovate](../innovate/index.md). It's important to identify and prioritize which horizon sequence best fits across your cloud adoption plan, based on your adoption goals.

Use the following horizons to establish your organization's adoption plan. These horizons support cloud adoption efforts by capturing prioritized tasks. Your cloud adoption plan maps to the metrics and motivations defined in your [cloud adoption strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/cloud-adoption-strategy-evaluator).

## Find the right horizon for you

Determine which horizon best fits your adoption goals and which business motivations and workloads are important to address first. The following image shows an example of a three-horizon adoption plan.

To limit complexity and unnecessary work and slowdowns, minimize the amount of effort that you spend on multiple horizons at once.

## Migrate

Cloud [migration](../migrate/index.md) is the process of moving applications, infrastructure, and data from one location, often a company's private, on-site ("on-premises") datacenter to a public cloud providerâ€™s infrastructure. As an example, migrating an on-premises physical or virtual server to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). The main cloud migration benefits include reducing IT costs, enhancing security and resilience, and on-demand scale.

## Modernize

Cloud [modernization](../modernize/index.md) is the process of updating existing (sometimes legacy) applications for newer computing approaches, including newer application frameworks and use of cloud-native technologies. This can be done using PaaS, Containers, Low code apps, and Database-as-a-Service architectures. Key benefits include app innovation, agility, developer velocity, and cost optimization.

## Innovate

[Innovation](../innovate/index.md) is the process of developing and applying ideas that improve the way things are done or what can be achieved. With focus on understanding your customer needs, you can rapidly invent and build inventions that shape how your customers interact with your products.

## Align horizons

Most likely, you're going to visit all three horizons during your cloud adoption journey. Based on your goals and priorities, you can determine which sequence works best for you. Do you want to [modernize or migrate first](migrate-modernize-approaches.md)? How will you [evaluate your modernization options](../modernize/business-alignment/evaluate-modernization-options.md)?
