# Modernization disciplines

The modernization disciplines include building skills required to execute repeatable processes, which accelerate modernization of multiple applications. Technical decision makers, architects, and engineers will move your company closer to a digital native state.

Align your developers, so they can modernize your application and data platforms and then test the architecture. Incorporate the following disciplines into your CAF modernization plan:

- [Align your developers for modernization](developer-alignment-modernization.md)
- [Modernize application platforms](application-platform-modernization.md)
- [Modernize data platforms](data-platform-modernization.md)
- [Perform architecture testing](testing-architecture-modernization.md)
- [Use devops practices for modernization](devops-practices-modernization.md)
