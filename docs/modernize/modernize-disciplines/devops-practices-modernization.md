# Modernize your process

Learn how to modernize your process. Increasing operational efficiency will limit the total cost of ownership of your workloads.

Modernize your process with an DevOps approach. DevOps uses an Agile framework to deliver continuous value to customers.

- *Focus* - Focus on continuously deliver value to customers.
- *How* - Integrate planning, development, delivery, and operations with Agile processes and DevOps tools.
- *Benefit* - Quickly limit the total cost of ownership of your workloads in the cloud.

## Modernize your workflow

Modernize your work cadence by adopting an Agile workflow. Take your mapping of modernization motivations and workloads that you created in [step 3 of the Envision phase](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md). You need to create structure around the work that needs to get done so you can modernize your workloads.

| Step | Activity | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Create large buckets of work (epics) | Combine your modernization motivation and workload. These are called epics in Agile. | Application innovation for the E-commerce website |
| 2. Identify major tasks (user stories) | Create major tasks from a user or customer perspective. These are called user stories in Agile. | As a shopper, I want a more responsive website so I have better shopping experience |
| 3. Identify smaller tasks within the major tasks (subtasks)| Break down the major tasks into smaller activities. These are called tasks or subtasks in Agile. | <ul> <li>Choose Azure App Service plan</li> <li>Configure security</li>  <li>Configure caching</li> </ul>
| 4. Divide up the work into management pieces (sprints) | Set a two-week time frame and let your team members take on tasks that they can complete over that two week period | <ul> <li>Joy takes "choose Azure App Service plan"</li> <li>Jaye takes "configure security"</li>  <li>Jon takes "configure caching"</li> </ul>|

## Modernize your tools

Modernize your tools by adopting a DevOps toolset. Five DevOps tools make this possible. Using [Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops) makes this adoption easy (*see table*).

| DevOps Tool | Tool Description | Solution | Alternative
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Repository* | A centralized location to store code and code changes | [Azure Repos](/azure/devops/repos/get-started/what-is-repos) | GitHub
| *Pipeline* | An automated process to validate and push code to a desired environment | [Azure Pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-get-started) | Jenkins
| *Boards* | A central dashboard that tracks the progress of work items | [Azure Boards](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/what-is-azure-boards) | TaskBoard |
| *Artifacts* | A tool to share code and publish packages | [Azure Artifacts](/azure/devops/artifacts/start-using-azure-artifacts) | Nexus
| *Testing* | A tool to run tests and quality assurance on code | [Azure Test Plans](/azure/devops/test/overview) | Selenium
