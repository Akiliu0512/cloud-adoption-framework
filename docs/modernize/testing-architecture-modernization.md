# Testing and architecture

IN PROGRESS

If you determine that your application needs some hybrid portability capabilities, we can understand what's needed on a workload-by-workload basis with a [Well-Architected Review](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-the-microsoft-azure-wellarchitected-framework/).

Align your workloads to your business values and disciplines to drive your desired outcomes. This action helps to create a pattern where you prioritize the buckets and set up repeatable processes to get faster time to market. You can modernize all of these workloads or deploy all of these application innovation workloads through some developer alignment techniques that are repeatable. Centralize your data using the Azure migration capabilities of moving from SQL Server to individual SQL instances.
