If you determine that your application needs some hybrid portability capabilities, we'll want to run a [Well-Architected Review](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-the-microsoft-azure-wellarchitected-framework/), so we can better understand on a workload-by-workload basis.

Align your workloads to your business values and disciplines to drive your desired outcomes. This action helps to create a pattern where you prioritize the buckets and set up repeatable processes to get faster time to market. You can modernize all of these workloads using ? or deploy all of these application innovation workloads through some developer alignment techniques that are repeatable. Centralize your data by using the Azure migration capabilities of moving from SQL Server to individual SQL instances.
