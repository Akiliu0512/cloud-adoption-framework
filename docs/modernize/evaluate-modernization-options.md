# Evaluate modernization options

Modernization disciplines

- Developer alignment
- Application platforms

Evaluate modernization paths, dependencies, and compatibility of your current state to establish realistic expectations.

## Developer alignment

Does the cost of modernization exceed your desired cost savings?
What's your break-even point?

If yes, Enabling hybrid work > Migration only

If no clue, you need a well-architected review.

### Technical indicators

- Can you modernize the workload? COTS?
- Are multiple modernization motivations mapped to any workloads?
- Is the business actively investing in maturing these workloads? Do these workloads create a competitive advantage?
- Once complete, will these workloads need to operate in hybrid or multi-cloud environment?

### Financial indicators

- Can you quantify the business value of modernizing these workloads?
- Have you compared the hosing costs of these workloads in a migrated vs. modernized approach?
- Are these workloads considered business-critical?

## Application platforms

- Are your workloads hybrid or portable?
- Hybrid workers > Migration only

- No clue > you need a well-architected review.

## Testing & architecture

## Data Platforms

## DevOps Practices
