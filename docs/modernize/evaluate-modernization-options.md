# Evaluate modernization options

Modernization disciplines

- Developer alignment
- Application platforms

Evaluate modernization paths, dependencies, and compatibility of current state to establish realistic expectations.

## Developer alignment

Does the cost of modernization exceed the desired cost savings?
What's your break-even point?

If no clue, you need a well-architected review.

### Technical indicators

- Can you modernize the workload? COTS?
- Are multiple modernization motivation mapped to any workloads?
- Is the business actively investing in maturing these workloads? Do these workloads create a competitive advantage?
- Once complete, will these workloads need to operate in hybrid or multi-cloud environment?

### Financial indicators

Can you quantify the business value of modernizing these workloads?
Have you compared the hosing costs of these workloads in a migrated vs. modernized approach?
Are these workloads considered business-critical?


## Application platforms
