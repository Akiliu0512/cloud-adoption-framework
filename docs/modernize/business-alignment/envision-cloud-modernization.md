# Envision cloud modernization

Envisioning modernization starts with understanding your cloud adoption motivations. These modernization motivations are your business goals. Your motivations will determine what you should modernize. Follow these steps to identify your motivations and the workloads you should modernize.

## Step 1: Identify modernization motivations

 Modernization motivations are the reasons you want to modernize. They drive revenue, improve productivity, and increase margins. Your motivations will be unique to your business goals. But commonalities exist across businesses and industries (*see figure*).

**Explaining Motivations:** Here are a some of the most common modernization triggers across industries:

- *Enabling hybrid work:* Make applications accessible and secure for remote productivity.
- *Faster time to market:* Increase deployment speed to see a faster return-on-investment.
- *Cost-optimizing applications:* Gain operational efficiencies to drive down the cost of ownership.
- *Application innovation:* Adopt new technologies and architectures to enable rapid innovation.
- *Centralize data:* Store application data in a centralized repository to enhance security, reduce redundancy, and drive transparency.

Knowing *why* you are modernizing will determine *what* to modernize.

## Step 2: Identify workloads

The cloud frees you to focus on workloads. After assessing your motivation triggers, start identifying your workloads. A [workload](../../plan/workloads.md) is a collection of IT assets (infrastructure, applications, and data) that support an aspect of your business. In a data center, IT assets are logically separate (*see figure*).

**How to idenitfy workloads:** List your primary business functions. Then, list the IT assets that support those functions. Those supporting IT assets are your workloads (*see table for examples*).

| <br>Business Function<span title="Business Function">&nbsp;</span> | <br>Supporting IT Assets<span title="Supporting IT Assets">&nbsp;</span> |
|--|--|
|E-commerce<br>Website| Web App<br>Business logic<br>Database<br>Servers<br>Payment System|
|Factory Production|Machine/Robot<br>IOT device<br>Programmable Logic Controller<br>Monitoring<br>Server
|

## Step 3: Align workloads and modernization motivations
Return to your motivations in step 1 and apply them to your workload list (*see table*). This will help you prioritize your modernization efforts.

|Factory Production|Machine/Robot<br>IOT device<br>Programmable Logic Controller<br>Monitoring<br>Server|Faster time to market<br>Data Centralization

## Next steps

Once you've mapped your motivations to workloads, determine your approach.
