# Commit to modernization in the cloud

Commit to modernization in the cloud by modernizing your operations and your workloads.

Modernization requires money, and the commit phase is where modernization receive the funding it needs. As part of the commitment phase, you gather key stakeholders:

- Business leads
- Technical leads

The technical leads team presents the ideal modernization path. The business leads agree to invest the time and money in that path.

## Step 1 - Commit to a modernization path

To get the most out of your cloud modernization efforts, you need to modernize your processes before, or in parallel with, your application and database modernization efforts.

A on-premises mindset in the cloud severely limits your cost efficiency potential. Modernizing your processes is the best way to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO) of your workloads in the cloud.

## Step 2 - Commit to a modernization strategy

Commit to a modernization strategy by align your modernization motivations to a modernization strategy. We covered five modernization motivations in the [envision step](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md) of the modernize methodology. Now, we can align specific strategies to each modernization motivation (*see table*).

|Modernization Motivation <br> (What is your goal?)| Modernization Strategy <br> (How to reach your goal)|
| --- | --- |
|*Enabling hybrid work*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Faster time-to-market*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Cost optimization*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|
|*Application innovation*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Centralizing data*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|

Process modernization is essential to experience the benefits of the cloud. It's a modernization strategy for each listed modernization motivation and is the best way to reduce the total cost of ownership in the cloud.

## Step 3 - Commit to a timeline

Commit to a timeline. The amount of time it takes to modernize your process and workloads depends on your team's experience and the complexity of your situation.

Check out our [Fast Track for Azure](/programs/azure-fasttrack/) program if you don't have the right experience on your team to estimate a timeline. You can also use one of our certified partners in the [Azure Migration and Modernization Program](/azure/partners/ammp) to get the advice you need.
