# Commit to modernization in the cloud

Commit to modernization in the cloud. Modernization requires an investment of time and money. The commit phase is where modernization receives the time and money investments it needs.

 As part of the commitment phase, you gather key stakeholders. The two primary groups are business leads and technical leads.

*Business leads* - Approve the time and financial investments in the modernization roadmap.

*Technical Leads* - Design and present the modernization roadmap.

## Step 1 - Align your modernization motivations to modernization strategies

Align your modernization motivations to modernization strategies. We covered five modernization motivations in the [envision step](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md). Pull out these motivations because you use them to determine what modernization strategies you'll commit to.

Most modernization motivations align two or more modernization strategies (*see table*).

|Modernization Motivation <br> (What is your goal?)| Modernization Strategy <br> (How to reach your goal)|
| --- | --- |
|*Enabling hybrid work*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Faster time-to-market*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Cost optimization*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|
|*Application innovation*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Centralizing data*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|

*Process modernization* - notice that *process modernization* is listed with every modernization motivation. Modernizing your process is essential to working in the cloud. It's the fastest way to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO). No matter you motivation for modernization, you need to modernize your process.

## Step 2 - Update your workload table with modernization strategies

Update your workload table with modernization strategies. Add the modernization strategies you identified in step 1 with the table you created in the [envision step of business alignment](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md) (*see the example below*).

|Business Function<span title="Business Function">&nbsp;</span> |Workload <span title="Supporting IT Assets">&nbsp;</span> |Motivation<span title="Motivation">&nbsp;</span> |Modernization Strategy
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|E-commerce<br>Website| Web App<br>Business logic<br>Database<br>Servers<br>Payment System|Application innovation |<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|Factory Production|Machine/Robot<br>IOT device<br>Programmable Logic Controller<br>Monitoring<br>Server|Centralizing Data|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|

## Step 3 - Create a modernization timeline for each workload

Create a modernization timeline. The amount of time it takes to modernize your workloads depends on your team's experience and the complexity of your situation (*see table*).

|Business Function<span title="Business Function">&nbsp;</span> |Workload <span title="Supporting IT Assets">&nbsp;</span> |Motivation<span title="Motivation">&nbsp;</span> |Modernization Strategy|Timeline|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|E-commerce<br>Website| Web App<br>Business logic<br>Database<br>Servers<br>Payment System|Application innovation |<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>| N-weeks|
|Factory Production|Machine/Robot<br>IOT device<br>Programmable Logic Controller<br>Monitoring<br>Server|Centralizing Data|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|N-weeks|

You might have the technical expertise to estimate the modernization effort. If not, here are some resources to get the expert advice you need.

## Step 4 - Commit resources to the modernization

Commit resources to the modernization. Business leads need to give the modernization effort a budget. The budget should allow the technical leads to put the right people on the project and give them the technical team the right tools.

## Next steps

By completing the steps above, you have created a high-level modernization roadmap. You have identified what, why, how, when, and who. Now you just need to commit resources to make the modernization a success. With your modernization roadmap and commitments in place, you can begin modernizing.
