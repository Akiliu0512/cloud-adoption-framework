# Commit to modernization in the cloud

Commit to modernization in the cloud by modernizing your operations and your workloads.

Modernization requires an investment of time and money. The commit phase is where modernization receives the time and money investments it needs. As part of the commitment phase, you gather key stakeholders:

- Business leads
- Technical leads

The technical leads team presents the ideal modernization path. The business leads agree to invest the time and money in that path.

## Step 1 - Commit to a modernization path

Commit to a modernization path by aligning your modernization motivations to a modernization strategy. We covered five modernization motivations in the [envision step](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md). Pull out these motivations because we use them here to create a modernization path.

Most modernization motivations map to two or more modernization strategies (*see table*).

|Modernization Motivation <br> (What is your goal?)| Modernization Strategy <br> (How to reach your goal)|
| --- | --- |
|*Enabling hybrid work*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Faster time-to-market*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Cost optimization*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|
|*Application innovation*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|*Centralizing data*|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|

Notice that process modernization is listed modernization motivation. Modernizing your process is essential to working in the cloud. It's the fastest way to reduce the total cost of ownership (TCO).

Use the table above to finalize your commitment path. Your commitment combines your workload, motivation, and strategy. See the example below. It builds on the table you created in the [envision step](../business-alignment/envision-cloud-modernization.md).

|Business Function<span title="Business Function">&nbsp;</span> |Workload <span title="Supporting IT Assets">&nbsp;</span> |Motivation<span title="Motivation">&nbsp;</span> |Modernization Strategy
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|E-commerce<br>Website| Web App<br>Business logic<br>Database<br>Servers<br>Payment System|Application innovation |<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Application modernization</li></ul>|
|Factory Production|Machine/Robot<br>IOT device<br>Programmable Logic Controller<br>Monitoring<br>Server|Centralizing Data|<ul><li>Process modernization</li><li>Database modernization</li></ul>|

## Step 2 - Commit to a timeline

Commit to a timeline. The amount of time it takes to modernize your process and workloads depends on your team's experience and the complexity of your situation.

Check out our [Fast Track for Azure](/programs/azure-fasttrack/) program if you don't have the right experience on your team to estimate a timeline. You can also use one of our certified partners in the [Azure Migration and Modernization Program](/azure/partners/ammp) to get the advice you need.

## Step 3 - Commit resources

Commit resources to your modernization path. You have your modernization path and have created a timeline. Now, you need to put the right people on the project and commit to giving them the right tools.

## Next steps

With a modernization path identified, you can begin modernizing.
