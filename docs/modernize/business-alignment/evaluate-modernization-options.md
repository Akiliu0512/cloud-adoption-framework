# Evaluate your readiness for cloud modernization

After you envision your cloud modernization possibilities, you need to evaluate if you're ready to modernize in the cloud. The evaluation is just two steps.

Evaluate your financial readiness first. Financial readiness shows you if you're ready to modernize or need more time reviewing your applications.

Then, evaluate your technical readiness. Technical readiness shows you if modernizing is the best path forward or if another path is better.

## Step 1 - Evaluate financial readiness

Financial motivations are the key drivers of cloud modernization. Businesses know that modernizations done right can increase operational efficiency and generate new revenue.

For each workload you're thinking about modernizing, answer the following questions. These are just example questions to get you thinking along the right lines. These questions are for workloads. They are not a general assessment or your organization or entire portfolio.

Answering *yes* to all questions means you're likely ready to modernize. If you answer *no* to any of the questions, we recommend you conduct a [well-architected review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=local) of your workload.

|Question|Yes|No|
|--|--|--|
|*Can you quantify the business<br> value of modernizing this workloads?*|Modernize|Review|
*Do you know what your <br>modernization cost will be?*|Modernize<br>|Review|
|*Are these workloads business-critical?*|Modernize|Review|
|*Does the cost of modernization<br> meet your desired cost savings?*|Modernize|Review|

Move on to step 2 when you've answered *yes* to all the above questions.

## Step 2 - Evaluate your technical readiness

The technical readiness assessment will help you figure out what cloud adoption strategy to take.

For each workload you're thinking about modernizing, answer the following questions. These are just example questions to get you thinking along the right lines. These questions are for workloads. They are not a general assessment or your organization or entire portfolio.

|Question|Yes|No|
|--|--|--|
|*Can you modernize the workload?*|Modernize| Migrate|
|*Is the business actively investing<br> in these workloads?*|Modernize|Replace|
|*Will these modernized workloads <br>need to operate in hybrid or<br> multi-cloud environment?* |Modernize|Migrate|
|*Are your workloads portable?*|Modernize|Migrate
|*Do you plan to keep the current architecture?*|Modernize|Review|
