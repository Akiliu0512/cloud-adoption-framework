# Evaluate if you're ready to modernize in the cloud

After you envision your cloud modernization possibilities, you need to evaluate if you're ready to modernize in the cloud.

The evaluation is two steps. It involves assessing your financial readiness and your technical readiness.

- *Financial readiness* - you're either ready to modernize or need more time to review your applications.
- *Technical readiness* - you're either ready to modernize or need to choose a different adoption path.

## Step 1 - Evaluate the financial readiness of each workload

Evaluate the financial readiness of each workload. This evaluation helps determine if it makes business sense to modernize your workload. Financial motivations are the key drivers of cloud modernization. Cloud modernizations can improve margins though efficiencies and generate new revenue streams. But to realize those benefits, you have evaluate the financial aspect of the effort.

For each workload you want to modernize, answer the following questions. The questions are examples to get you thinking along the right lines.

Answering *yes* to all questions means you're likely ready to modernize. If you answer *no* to any of the questions, we recommend you conduct a [well-architected review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&session=local) of your workload.

|Question|Yes|No|
|--|--|--|
|*Can you quantify the business<br> value of modernizing the workload?*|Modernize|Conduct<br>Review|
*Do you know what your <br>modernization cost will be?*|Modernize<br>|Conduct<br>Review|
|*Are these workloads business-critical?*|Modernize|Conduct<br>Review|
|*Does the cost of modernization<br> meet your desired cost savings?*|Modernize|Conduct<br>Review|

If answered *yes* to all the financial readiness questions, the workload is likely ready to adopt the cloud. The technical readiness evaluation will help you determine if you're ready to modernize or take another adoption path.

## Step 2 - Evaluate the technical readiness of each workload

Evaluate the technical readiness of each workload. This evaluation helps determine what cloud adoption strategy you should to take. It will help you see if your workload is ready for modernization or if it is better fit for a different cloud adoption strategy altogether (e.g. migrate or replace).

For each workload you want to modernize, answer the following questions. The questions are very simple and just meant to get you thinking along the right lines.

|Question|Yes|No|
|--|--|--|
|*Do you have enough control over the workload to modernize it?*|Modernize| Migrate|
|*Is your business actively investing<br> in these workloads?*|Modernize|Replace|
|*Will these modernized workloads <br>need to operate in hybrid or<br> multi-cloud environment?* |Modernize|Migrate|
|*Are your workloads portable?*|Modernize|Migrate|
|*Do you plan to keep the current architecture?*|Modernize|Conduct<br>Review|

If you answered *yes* to all the technical-readiness questions, you're likely ready to modernize the workload.

## Next steps

You have envisioned and evaluated. You still need to commit to a modernization path.
