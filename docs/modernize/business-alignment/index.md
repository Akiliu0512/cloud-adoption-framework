# Business alignment for cloud modernization

Business alignment is the first step in the modernize horizon. It is the process of prioritizing business goals, identifying the business processes that support those goals, and enhancing the technology used in those processes. We have broken these actions into three processes: envision, evaluate, and commit (*see figure*).

These are sequential processes. You have to envision your business goals before you evaluate the modernization possibilities to achieve those goals. When you know the possibilities, you can commit your business to them. The modernization disciplines will help you build the technical skills and processes to execute.
