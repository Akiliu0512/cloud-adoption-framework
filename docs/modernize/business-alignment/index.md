# Business alignment for cloud modernization

Aligning your business to your cloud modernization goals is the first step in modernizing your organization. The "business alignment" process is where you:

- Envision your modernization possibilities.
- Evaluate your financial and technical readiness.
- Commit to the modernization path you choose.
