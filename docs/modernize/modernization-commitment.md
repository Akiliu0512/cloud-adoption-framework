# Modernization commitment

When you consider making a commitment to modernization, be sure to evaluate your goals and tasks. Start to think through the efforts of establishing epics, creating user stories and tasks, determining iterations, and aligning your priorities. Then, you can obtain commitment from your stakeholders.

## Evaluate

Ask the following questions to help you move toward commitment:

- How long will it take to modernize you workloads?
- Do you have the skills to modernize? Do you need a vendor? If so, what does it cost?
- What work needs to be done before modernization?
- Are we committed to move forward?
- How do we prioritize those commitments?

## Personnel

There are generally the following three groups from which it's important to get a commitment:

- Business lead
- Technical lead
- Technical team - usually your business leads or an individual person, technical teams, or a group of people, which could include a partner

Make sure they're named, identified, and have agreed to the backlog of commitments. If not committed, you'll want a Well Architected Framework Review and then evaluate afterward to see if you can proceed with modernization.

## Work

Workloads that have undergone any significant architectural change will go back through Well Architected Framework review.

|Effort  |Description |Examples    |
|---------|---------|--------|
|Epics    |Captures business value and overall transformation and records the overall wave of things to modernize, grouped around a common set of modernization behaviors. What do you need to do per workload as you go through modernization to a common foundation set of technology?   |Landing zone accelerator, Azure Migrate Tool, or Cost Optimizing App.     |
|User stories     | Capture each workload to track your work      |    |
|Tasks     | Capture the environmental configurations associated with your architecture or other dependencies. Repeatable processes.        |    |

## Prioritize

Rate on a 1-10 scale.

## Iterate

- Make sure your environment is ready, like the SQL management instance
- Database scaling work takes about two weeks

## Example effort


Now you can execute and manage your engagement going forward.
