# Developer alignment

If your desired cost savings are bigger than the cost of modernization, it's a good idea to align your developers and see what they can do to optimize. Your business might have different rules if you're already doing numerous application platform motions. It might seem as though your majority of cost savings is through application platform improvements, but companies tend to lean more towards developer alignment as a way to get there.

While the cloud presents the opportunity to learn new skills, your developers should know how to directly apply their experiences and subject matter expertise.

You can use any language. With sufficient developer alignment and practices, we've seen our customers successfully modernize and adopt the cloud, using their choice of language.
