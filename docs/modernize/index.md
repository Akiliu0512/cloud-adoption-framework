# Modernize in the cloud

Modernization is where you begin to unlock the benefits of the cloud. Migration got you to the cloud. Modernization lets you capitalize on the cloud.

## Maximizing value

Modernization is about maximizing value for your business. The goal is to make the biggest impact with the least amount of effort. The result of modernization is a digital transformation that reduces management burden, increases performance, and minimizes cost. These outcomes are critical to driving growth.

## Scope of modernization

Modernization is a loaded term. It means different things to different people. So letâ€™s define what we mean by modernization.

Modernization is enhancing your workloads and the process to support those workloads. Let's address each aspect:

1. *Process modernization* - Modernizing your process means adopting a DevOps methodology. Process modernization must come before you modernize your workloads.

1. *Workload modernization* - Modernizing your workloads means adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). This definition is oversimplified, but it applies to most scenarios.

## How to modernize

We developed a framework that walks you through the most effective modernization processes. The first step is aligning your modernization to your business goals. Based on these goals, you'll determine:

- When to modernize
- What to modernize

You'll create a modernization roadmap that identifies the workloads you need to modernize and the modernization strategies you need to use.

With the modernization roadmap created, you can begin modernizing. You'll adopt new methodologies and new technologies to enhance your processes, applications, and databases.

## Next steps

Modernization starts with business alignment
