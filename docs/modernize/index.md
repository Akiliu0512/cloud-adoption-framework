# Modernize in the cloud

Modernization is when you enhance your workloads and the processes to support those workloads. It's all about maximizing value and adopting cloud technologies that allow you to unlock more benefits of the cloud. The goal of modernization is to make the cloud work for you. Modernization can improve operational efficiency. It can reduce management overhead and optimize costs. Cloud modernization allows your business or organization to be more productive with less. Efficiency at this scale should be a priority.

Modernization is not complicated. We recommend modernizing in two phases:

- [Phase 1. Business alignment](#step-1-business-alignment)
- [Phases 2. Modernization strategies](#step-2-modernization-strategies)

Below you'll find an overview of each phase and guidance on where to start your modernization journey. We developed a framework that walks you through the most effective modernization processes.

## Phase 1. Business alignment

Phase 1 of modernization is is aligning your modernization efforts to your business goals. You will identify your business goals and determine:

- What to modernize
- When to modernize

As part of this phase, you'll create a modernization roadmap. The roadmap will identify the workloads you need to modernize and the modernization strategies you need to use.

With the modernization roadmap created, you can begin modernizing. You'll adopt new methodologies and new technologies to enhance your processes, applications, and databases.

## Phase 2. Modernization strategies

Phase 2 is where you implement essential modernization strategies. This is where change happens.

- **Process modernization** - To modernize your process, we recommend adopting a DevOps methodology. DevOps wil help expedite your modernization efforts. Process modernization is so key to workload modernization that it's a necessary prerequisite to workload modernization.

- **Workload modernization** - Modernizing your workloads means adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). This definition is oversimplified, but it applies to most scenarios.

Modernization starts with business alignment
