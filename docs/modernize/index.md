# Modernize in the cloud

Modernization is where you begin to unlock the benefits of the cloud. Migration got you to the cloud. Modernization lets you capitalize on the cloud.

**Maximizing value:**

Modernization is about maximizing value for your business. The goal is to make the biggest impact with the least amount of effort. The result of modernization is a digital transformation that reduces management burden, increases performance, and minimizes cost. The results of modernization are critical to driving growth.

**Definition of modernization:**

Modernization is a loaded term. It means different things to different people. So letâ€™s define what we mean by modernization. Modernization has two scopes: process and workloads. You need to modernize your development and operations processes, and you need to modernize your workloads.

1. *Process* - Modernizing your process means adopting a DevOps methodology. Process modernization must come before you modernize your workloads.

1. *Workloads* - Modernizing your workloads means adopting platform-as-a-service solutions (PaaS). This definition is oversimplified, but it applies to most scenarios.

**How to modernize:**
