# Modernize your apps and data

When your cloud adoption journey includes modernization, you might need to repackage, redesign, and rebuild your apps and data. Modernization helps you achieve benefits like boosting app innovation, increasing agility, and accelerating developer velocity.

The following exercises help establish the iterative processes to assess, migrate, optimize, secure, and manage those workloads.

## Methodology overview

This methodology is designed to help you modernize a portfolio of applications at scale using repeatable processes. For modernization of individual workloads and deeper review of architectural decisions, consult W Architecture Framework (WAF).

## Repackage apps and databases for speed and productivity

When you want to make minimal changes and ensure they connect to Azure, repackage your apps and databases. For example, you might want to reposition relational databases directly into a cloud database service like [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/?view=azuresql&preserve-view=true).

## Redesign apps and databases for cloud scalability and productivity

Redesign apps and databases when you want to modify and extend app functionality and code to optimize for cloud scalability. For example, break down monolithic apps into groups of microservices that work together and scale.

## Rebuild with cloud-native technologies to accelerate developer velocity

Consider rebuilding if your existing apps have limited functionality or lifespan. Re-create your apps using Azure cloud solutions. For more information, see [Build a digital transformation timeline](../strategy/digital-transformation-timeline.md).

Modernization is a continuous process that involves significant organizational change management spanning people, process, and technology. Taking a holistic approach helps you navigate the journey successfully and helps ensure that your organization realizes new benefitsâ€”including efficiency, agility, and scale, after your workloads are running in the cloud.

## Modernization examples

Modify or extend your apps to further scale and optimize for cloud architectures. Take advantage of Azure platform and service capabilities such as built-in security, patching, high availability, and auto-scaling. Typical projects, which include migration, can be found in [Azure best practices](../migrate/azure-best-practices/index.md).
