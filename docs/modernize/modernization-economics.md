# Modernization economics

Digital transformation is an economic imperative. A transformation strategy drives innovation and growth. Organizations that harness data, the cloud, and AI are driving innovation and growth and outperforming their peers. 

Compatibility or large collections of workloads.

## Motivation

Let's evaluate from both the technical and a financial perspective.

So when you're thinking about modernizing things, there's a couple of different strategies that would drive this type of motion. Motivators tend to be more around generating new income, generating new operating income, in particular by modernizing and getting more usage of...

With the technology that they have out there and maybe even creating market differentiators and realistically to justify any kind of modernization effort, you wanna see some operating income coming from this, not just operating margin.

We've put the types of modernization into the following three groups to show....:

- Operating margin: Automating ongoing administrative work, like patching, networking, firewall configuration, with the SASS service or pass services that we have.

- Motivators: generating new income (operating income and margin), modernizing and getting more usage of the technology, creating market differentiators
produces some significant...

- Infrastructure: Operating margin: reduce administrative work, patching, firewall administration
Apps and data, getting to market faster, drive innovations, improve delivery time by 50%

## Technical indicators

Evaluate indicators that would determine whether or not a workloads

One of the most common easy to weed out:

- Can you modernize the workload? 
  - COTS?Commercial Of the shelf...Solutions...
- Are multiple modernization motivations mapped to any workloads?
- Is the business actively investing in maturing these workloads? 
- Do these workloads create a competitive advantage? Built with the support of a consulting firm?
- Will these workloads need to operate in hybrid or multi-cloud environment?

## Financial indicators

- Can you quantify the business value of modernizing these workloads? 
- Have you forecasted your cost savings? 
- Are you actively investing in that workload? 
  - Workloads that don't create a competitive advantage anymore, or workloads that were built with the support of a consulting firm, but aren't managed anymore? 
  - Can you quantify those business values? 
  - Are they really going to lead to revenue? 
  - Have you forecasted that revenue? 
  - If they're gonna lead to cost savings, have you forecasted how you're going to realize that cost savings? 
  - And is it real? For instance, if you save a little bit of admin time, unfortunately, you can only often times realize that revenue savings if you let go of some of your people. So that's a little bit of a soft cost that's hard to quantify.
- Whenever we're done with these modernizations, are you going to need to operate in hybrid and multi cloud environment?
- Have you compared the hosting costs of these workloads in a migrated vs modernized approach? A lot of times people don't think about that and some modernization efforts can actually increase your cost.
- Are these workloads considered business-critical? If outages of a workload truly are business critical and downtime costs you money in the 1,000,000 per hour, the cost of runtime doesn't matter as much.

If something truly is business critical, then it's probably a good candidate for modernization.


We talked about the modernization motives LINK and mapping different workload categories to those motivations. Some workloads are going to get mapped to multiple modernization motivations, so it's important to look for.
