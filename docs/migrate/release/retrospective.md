# How do retrospective help build a growth mindset?

Retrospectives reinforce the principles of a growth mindset: experimentation, testing, learning, sharing, growing, and empowering. They provide a safe place for team members to share the challenges faced in the current sprint. And they allow the team to discuss and collaborate on ways to overcome those challenges. Retrospectives empower the team to create sustainable growth.

## Retrospective structure

The general structure of a retrospective is to ask the following questions. During these meetings, each member of the team is expected to contribute a thought regarding three basic questions:

- What went well?
- What could be done better?
- What did we learn?

Although these questions are simple in nature, they require employees to pause and reflect on their work over the last iteration. This small pause for introspection is the primary building block of a growth mindset. The humility and honesty produced when sharing the answers can become infectious beyond the time contract for the retrospective meeting.

## Leadership's role in a retrospective

The topic of leadership involvement in a retrospective is highly debated. Many technical teams suggest that leaders of any level shouldn't be involved in the process, since it could discourage transparency and open dialogue. Others suggest that retrospectives are a good place for leaders to stay connected and to find ways to provide additional support. This decision is best left to the team and its leadership structure.

If leaders are involved in the retrospective, one role is highly encouraged. The leader's primary duty in a retrospective is to make the team feel safe. Creating a growth mindset within a culture requires employees to be free to share their failures and successes without fear of rebuke. Leaders who applaud the courage and humility required to admit shortcomings are more likely to see a growth mindset established in their teams. When leaders take action on data points shared in a retrospective, they're likely to see this tool become an ineffective formality.

## Lessons learned

The retrospective marks the end of a release or iteration, as teams gain experience and learn lessons, and they adjust the release and iteration backlog to reflect new processes and experiments to be tested. This starts the next iteration through the migration processes.

Teams migrating the next migration wave should apply the lessons learned to continually improve the migration.
