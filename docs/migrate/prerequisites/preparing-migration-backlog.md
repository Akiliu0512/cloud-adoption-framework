# Preparing your migration backlog

Prior to beginning your iterative migration activities, you should define a backlog of all workloads you intended to migrate. This backlog can be comprehensive, or it can focus on early adopters to prove the value of cloud adoption prior to making larger investments. However, this migration backlog should be completed as a first prerequisite.

This article serves as a milestone to complete prerequisite activities for building this backlog. The cloud strategy team is accountable for the care and maintenance of the digital estate. However, the realization of the resultant backlog is the responsibility of every member of the migration effort. As a final prerequisite, the cloud strategy team and the cloud adoption team should review and understand the migration backlog before planning individual workload activities. During that review, the members of both teams must gain sufficient knowledge to articulate the following key points in the migration backlog.

## Business outcomes and metrics

Every member of the team should understand the desired business outcomes. Migrations take time. It's easy for team members to become distracted by urgent but less important activities during migration. Establishing and reinforcing the desired outcomes helps the team understand the priority and relative importance of the migration, enabling better decision-making over time.

Tracking migration progress is equally important to the team's motivation and to continued stakeholder support. Progress can be tracked through migration KPIs and learning metrics. Regardless of how the effort is tracked, it's important that the team is aware of these metrics so that they can evaluate performance during subsequent iterations.

## Business priorities

Sometimes, prioritizing one workload over another might seem illogical to the cloud adoption team. Understanding the business priorities that drove those decisions can help maintain the team's motivation. It also allows the team to make a stronger contribution to the prioritization process.

## Core assumptions

The article on [digital estate rationalization](../../digital-estate/rationalize.md) discusses the agility and time-saving impact of basic assumptions when evaluating a digital estate. To fully realize those values, the cloud adoption team needs to understand the assumptions and the reasons that they were established. That knowledge better equips the cloud adoption team to challenge those assumptions.

## Capturing the backlog

The backlog needs to be captured in a location that can be shared so that different team member can align to it, and it can be updated throughout the migration process. You can use tools that your organization is comfortable with, and build upon the tools you used to perform your digital estate rationalization.

If you're looking for prebuilt templates, the [Migration Execution Guide](https://github.com/Azure/migration) (MEG) has prebuilt spreadsheets to help you organize your backlog.

It's important to associate individual servers with the workload, so that you can track the workload itself through individual server migrations. You can also use this backlog to showcase dependencies between workloads as you complete the assessment. When you get to [remediate assets](../deploy/remediate.md) and perform testing, you merge this with a remediation plan.

This backlog is used throughout the migration process, so maintaining it's critical.
