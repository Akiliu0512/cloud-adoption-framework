# Prepare for cloud migration

The objective of the preparation discipline is to ensure readiness of your business and technical environments prior to beginning an iterative migration plan.

- Your **business environment** is typically your business culture, context, and objectives for driving the migration, including the required mindset shift and ensuring cultural readiness.
- Your **technical environment** is typically your cloud provider platform.

## Definition of done

The preparation phase is considered complete when:

- **Business readiness**: Roles, responsibilities, and expectations have been defined and agreed upon; the migration backlog review is complete; the necessary skills are in place; and partnership options have been evaluated.
- **Technical readiness**: A landing zone has been established and prepared for migration on the cloud hosting provider, and the required migration tools have been evaluated.
