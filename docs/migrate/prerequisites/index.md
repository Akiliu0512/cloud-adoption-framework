# Prepare workloads for migration - Overview

Prior to planning individual workload migrations, there are several key decisions and processes you need to execute to ready your organization and cloud resources to support the migration. Many of these are covered earlier in the Cloud Adoption Framework, and some are decisions made that will impact all future migration activities.

The Prepare section provides you with guidance to tackle both of these action sets, so that you can begin to migrate with a secure foundation and plan.

Organizations that fail to adequately prepare for migrations might see their migrations stall as they have to go back and remediate activities. Some might find that the process becomes so bogged down that the migration has to be abandoned, and resumed at a later date once activities are completed. To avoid this, make sure you have a plan for addressing all of the readiness items.

To help organize your readiness, you can use the cloud migration readiness assessment.
