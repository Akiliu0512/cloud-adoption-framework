# Prepare for cloud migration

The objective of the preparation discipline is to ensure readiness of your business and technical environments prior to beginning an iterative migration plan.

- Your **business environment** is typically your business culture, context, and objectives for driving the migration, including the required mindset shift and ensuring cultural readiness.
- Your **technical environment** is typically your cloud provider platform.

## Definition of done

The preparation discipline is typically completed when the following are true:

- **Business readiness:** Roles, responsibilities, and expectations are defined and agreed upon, the migration backlog review is complete, the necessary skills are in place, and the partnership options are evaluated.
- **Technical readiness:** A landing zone is in place on the cloud hosting provider, and you have evaluated the required migration tools.

The remaining articles in this section will guide you through a successful preparation.
