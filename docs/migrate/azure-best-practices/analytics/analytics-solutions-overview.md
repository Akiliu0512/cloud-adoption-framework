# Analytics solutions

Current market offerings fall short in meeting an organizations growing needs. The legacy on-premise environments including Teradata, Netezza, and Oracle Exadata are expensive, slow to innovate, and inelastic.  Existing users of on-premise systems are now considering taking advantage of the innovations that are provided by newer environments (for example, cloud, IaaS, PaaS), and looking to delegate tasks, such as infrastructure maintenance and platform development to the cloud provider.
Microsoft Azure is a globally available, highly secure, scalable cloud environment, which includes Azure Synapse within an eco-system of supporting tools and capabilities.

Azure Synapse provides best-of-breed relational database performance by using techniques such as massively parallel processing (MPP) and automatic in-memory caching. The results of this approach can be seen in independent benchmarks such as the one run recently by [GigaOm](https://gigaom.com), which compares Azure Synapse to other popular cloud data warehouse offerings. Organizations that have already migrated to this environment have seen many benefits including:

- Improved performance and price/performance
- Increased agility and shorter time to value
- Faster server deployment and application development
- Elastic scalability â€“ only pay for actual usage
- Improved security/compliance
- Reduced storage and Disaster Recovery costs
- Lower overall TCO and better cost control (OPEX)

To maximize these benefits it is necessary to migrate existing (or new) data and applications to the Azure Synapse platform. In many organizations this includes migration of an existing data warehouse from legacy on-premise platforms such as Teradata, Netezza, or Exadata. Organizations need to modernize their data estate with an analytics offering that is price-performant, rapidly innovates, and that is scalable and truly elastic. Learn more in the following sections for migration best practices on Teradata, Netezza, and Exadata.
