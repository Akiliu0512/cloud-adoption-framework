# Analytics solutions

Current market offerings fall short in meeting an organization's growing needs. Legacy on-premises environments, including Teradata, Netezza, and Oracle Exadata, are expensive, slow to innovate, and inelastic. Organizations that use on-premises systems are now considering taking advantage of the innovations that are provided by newer environments in cloud, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS) offerings. Organizations are looking to delegate tasks, such as infrastructure maintenance and platform development, to the cloud provider. Microsoft Azure is a globally available, highly secure, and scalable cloud environment, which includes Azure Synapse Analytics within an ecosystem of supporting tools and capabilities.

Azure Synapse Analytics provides best-of-class relational database performance through techniques like massively parallel processing (MPP) and automatic in-memory caching. The results of this approach can be seen in independent benchmarks like the one run recently by [GigaOM](https://gigaom.com), which compares Azure Synapse Analytics to other popular cloud data warehouse offerings. Organizations that have already migrated to this environment have seen many benefits, including:

- Improved performance and price for performance
- Increased agility and shorter time to value
- Faster server deployment and application development
- Elastic scalability to ensure you pay only for what you use
- Improved security and compliance
- Reduced storage and disaster recovery costs
- Lower overall TCO and better cost control (operating expenses)

To maximize these benefits, it's necessary to migrate existing (or new) data and applications to the Azure Synapse Analytics platform. In many organizations, this approach includes migrating an existing data warehouse from a legacy on-premises platform like Teradata, Netezza, or Exadata. Organizations need to modernize their data estate with an analytics offering that is price-performant, rapidly innovative, scalable, and truly elastic. Learn more in the following sections for migration best practices on Teradata, Netezza, and Exadata.
