# Migration preparation checklist

Prior to planning individual workload migrations, there are several key decisions and processes you need to execute to ready your organization and cloud resources to support the migration. Some of these are covered earlier in the Cloud Adoption Framework, and some are decisions made that will impact all future migration activities.

This section provides you with guidance to prepare for your migrations with a secure foundation and plan.

**It's important to prepare**. Organizations that fail to prepare for migrations might see their migrations stall as they have to go back and remediate activities. Some might find that the process becomes overwhelmed that the migration has to be abandoned and resumed at a later date once activities are completed. To avoid this, make sure you have a plan for addressing all of the readiness items.
