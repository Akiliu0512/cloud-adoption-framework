# Empower adoption

::: zone-end

Organizations recognize that innovation is critical to business success. Innovation is not achieved solely through the introduction of new technologies. Rather, it requires a deep focus on supporting the people who catalyze change and create the new value organizations seek. **Developers** are at the center of digital transformation, and empowering them to achieve more requires accelerating developer velocity. Unleashing the creative energy of developer teams requires a deep focus on making them build productively, fostering global and secure collaboration, and removing barriers to scale innovation.

## Value generation

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Regardless of industry, every organization is trying to do one thing: drive constant value generation.
> - The focus on innovation is essentially a process to help your organization find new ways of generating value.
> - Perhaps the greatest mistake organizations make repeatedly is trying to create new value by looking to technology for the answer.
> - Sometimes the prevailing attitude is "if we just use more technology, we'll see things improve." However, innovation is first and foremost a people story.
> - Innovation is about the combination of people and technology.

Organizations that successfully innovate see vision, strategy, culture, unique potential, and capabilities as the foundational elements, then turn to technology with a specific purpose in mind. Every company is becoming a software company. Software engineer hiring is growing at faster rate outside the tech industry than inside, according to LinkedIn data.

Innovation is achieved when organizations support their people to create the value they seek. One group of people that is a catalyst for innovation is your developers. Developers play an increasingly vital role in value creation and growth across every industry. Developers are the builders of our era, writing the world's code and sitting at the heart of innovation. Innovative organizations build a culture that empowers developers to achieve more.

## Developer velocity

Empowering developers to invent means accelerating developer velocity&mdash;enabling them to create more, innovate more, and solve more problems. Developer velocity is the underpinning of each organization's tech intensity. Developer velocity is not only about speed, but also about unleashing developer ingenuity&mdash;turning your developer's ideas into software with speed and agility so that innovative solutions can be built. Azure's differentiated solution is uniquely positioned to unleash innovation within your organization.

## Build productively

There are two areas of opportunity where Azure can help you build productively:
  
> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Ensuring developers become and stay proficient in their domain by helping them advance their knowledge.
> - Hone the right skills by giving them the right tools.

One of the best ways to improve your developers' skills is giving them tools they know and love. Azure tools meet developers where they are today and introduce them to new technologies in the context of the code they're writing. With Azure's commitment to open source software, and support for all languages and frameworks in our tools, your developers can build how they want and deploy where you want.

Azure DevOps provides best-in-class tools for every developer. Azure developer services infuse modern development practices and emerging trends into our tools. With the Azure platform, developers have access to the latest technologies as well as a cutting-edge toolchain that supports the way they work.

# [Innovate collaboratively](#tab/Collaboration)

## Innovate through collaboration

Software development is a team sport. Collaboration with peers and knowledge sharing within the team is fundamental. Breaking down barriers between development and operations is essential. There is also a wealth of organizational knowledge outside of the core product team that can be tapped through platforms like GitHub. GitHub, the largest developer community, is at the heart of the open-source community and will always be an open platform that supports all developers. Collaboration is at the heart of GitHub&mdash;developers made over 1 billion contributions over the course of a year to the open-source projects and private repos that are hosted on GitHub. It is where developers collaborate, store their source code, and manage continuous integration.

**Go to [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams)**

## Open-source innovation

To innovate, many developers leverage open-source code&mdash;80% to 90% of new application development begins with open-source code. Open source isn't just about code, it's also about interconnected communities and developers around the globe building together. Leveraging an open development model using GitHub, teams innovate and collaborate, identify security vulnerabilities early, and discover expert talent. Enterprise development teams can integrate GitHub repos with Microsoft Teams and Azure. Teams is the only solution that brings together chat, voice, and collaboration with the power of Microsoft Office apps, meetings, and business process workflows, all in a single user experience. It's the hub for teamwork and innovation.

# [Innovation characteristics](#tab/Characteristics)

## Innovate using Azure DevOps

Enterprises use GitHub for hosting source code and use Azure Pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery to quickly deploy changes to Azure. Connect Azure Boards with GitHub repositories to take advantage of the rich project management capabilities provided by Azure Boards that spans Kanban boards, backlogs, team dashboards, and custom reporting.

## Characteristics of innovative applications

With Azure, your developers can build cloud-native applications using canonical modern application patterns. Azure supports and provides all the building blocks that your developer teams need to build applications using containers, managed databases, artificial intelligence, and serverless capabilities.

## Scale innovation

Sparking innovation for customer experiences and line-of-business applications is top of mind for every business leader. Whether you are building web, mobile, IoT, or mixed reality experiences, innovation is key to the future success of your organization. To scale innovation, organizations need to focus on packaging and shipping their unique business value as composable services, so that partners and employees can participate in shared value generation easily and efficiently. Azure has a unique offering to help you spark and scale innovation in your organization. To drive more innovation, professional developers today can create applications and building blocks that empower other experts in your organization to build apps on a reliable foundation. With Azure, they get security from the ground up, backed by a team of experts, and proactive compliance trusted by enterprises, governments, and startups.

# [LiveOps innovation](#tab/LiveOps)

## Future-ready: LiveOps

LiveOps is a design process for continual engagement with customers where the end-to-end customer journey is the focus. It's an approach to design and direction&mdash;focused on delivering value to your customers, emphasizing customer satisfaction and outcomes. LiveOps also helps humanize data. A LiveOps approach makes data more actionable, so your organization can take actions, in real time, that will have an impact on your apps, your customers, and your business. It's a process focused on experimentation, emphasizing iteration and evolution, driving consistent and frequent change. LiveOps is an approach to combining DevOps with your CRM. Innovative organizations are embracing a mentality of live operations (LiveOps).

## LiveOps transition

Game development is an example of an industry embracing LiveOps today. Modern games are the iconic LiveOps applications. Games have been going through a quiet revolution, transforming from packaged goods with a lifetime measured in hours, to active communities with a lifetime measured in years. With over two billion gamers, and tens of thousands of new games shipping every year fighting for attention, game developers are turning toward LiveOps to better engage and retain their player base over time. Innovation happens through continuous player engagement&mdash;content updates, special events, promotions, and offers.

## Azure PlayFab

[Azure PlayFab](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/playfab) is a complete backend platform for live games and an example of an application platform leading in LiveOps.
