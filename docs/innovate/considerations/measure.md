# Measure for customer impact

There are several ways to measure for customer impact. This article will aid in defining measures which can help validate hypotheses created while attempting [build with customer empathy](./build.md).

## Strategic metrics

During the [strategy phase](../../strategy/index.md) of the cloud adoption lifecycle, readers are guided through the creation and documentation of [motivations](../../strategy/motivations.md) and [business outcomes](../../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md). These exercises provide a set of metrics to use as a test of customer impact. When innovation is successful, it will produce results aligned with strategy objectives.

Before establishing learning metrics, define a small number of strategic metrics this innovation is expected to impact. Generally those strategic metrics will align to one or more of the following outcome areas: [Business Agility](../../strategy/business-outcomes/agility-outcomes.md), [Customer Engagement](../../strategy/business-outcomes/engagement-outcomes.md), [Customer Reach](../../strategy/business-outcomes/reach-outcomes.md), [Financial impact](../../strategy/business-outcomes/fiscal-outcomes.md), or in the case of operational innovation: [Solution Performance](../../strategy/business-outcomes/fiscal-outcomes.md).

Document the agreed upon metrics and track impact frequently. But, don't expect results in any of these metrics to emerge for several iterations. See [commitment to iteration](./index.md#commitment-to-iteration) to align expectations.

Aside from motivation and business outcome metrics, the remainder of this article will focus on learning metrics designed to guide transparent discovery and customer focused iterations. See [commitment to transparency](./index.md#commitment-to-transparency) to align expectations.

## Learning metrics

When the first version of any minimum viable product (MVP) is shared with customers, preferably at the end of the first development iteration, there will be no impact on strategic metrics. Several iterations later, the team may still be struggling to change behaviors enough to materially impact strategic metrics. During learning processes, such as build-measure-learn cycles, it is advised that the team adopt learning metrics. These metrics can more easily be tracked and leveraged in opportunities to learn.

### Customer flow and learning metrics

If an MVP solution validates a customer-focused hypothesis, the solution will drive some change in customer behaviors. Those behaviors across various customer cohorts will drive business outcomes. Fortunately, changing customer behaviors is often a multi-step process. Each step provides an opportunity to measure impact, so that the adoption team can learn and build a better solution.

Learning about changes to customer behaviors starts by mapping the desired flow created by a MVP solution.

In most cases, a customer flow will have an easily defined starting point and no more than two end points. Between the start and end points are a variety of learning metrics to be used as measures in the feedback loop:

1. **Starting point - initial trigger:** The starting point is the scenario which triggers the need for this solution. When the solution is built with customer empathy, that initial trigger should inspire a customer to try the MVP solution.
2. **Customer need met:** The hypothesis is validated when a customer need has been met by using the solution.
3. **Solution steps:** Each step required to move the customer from the initial trigger to a successful outcome is a solution step. Each step produces a learning metric based on customer decisions to move to the next step.
4. **Individual adoption achieved:** The next time the trigger is encountered, if the customer returns to the solution to have the need met again, then individual adoption is achieved.
5. **Business outcome indicator:** When a customer behaves in a way that positively contributes to the defined business outcome, a business outcome indicator is observed.
6. **True Innovation:** When "business outcome indicators" and "individual adoption" both occur at the desired scale, true innovation has been experienced.

Each step of the customer flow generates learning metrics. After each iteration (or release), a new version of the hypothesis is tested. At the same time, tweaks to the solution are tested to reflect adjustments in the hypothesis. When customers follow the prescribed path at any given step, a positive metric is recorded. When customers deviate from the prescribed path to meeting their need, a negative metric is recorded.

These alignment and deviation counters create learning metrics. Each should be recorded and tracked as the cloud adoption team progresses toward the realization of business outcomes and true innovation. In the next article, [learning with customer partners](./learn.md) we'll discuss ways to leverage these metrics to learn and build better solutions.

### Grouping and observing customer partners

The first measurement to define learning metrics is the customer partner definition. Any customer participating in innovation cycles qualifies as a customer partner. To accurately measure behavior, it is important to define customer partners in a cohort model. In this model, customers are grouped to best understand how they respond to any changes in the MVP. Customer partners are commonly grouped based on data points like the following:

- **Experiment or focus group:** Grouping based on a customers participation in a specific experiment to test changes over time.
- **Segment:** Grouping customers by the size of the company.
- **Vertical:** Grouping customers by the industry vertical they represent.
- **Individual demographics:** Grouping based on personal demographics like age or physical location.

This type of grouping allows for validation of learning metrics across various cross-sections of those customers who choose to partner with you during innovation efforts. All subsequent metrics should be observed based on a definable customer grouping.

## Next steps

As learning metrics are accumulated, the team can begin to [learn with customers](./learn.md).
