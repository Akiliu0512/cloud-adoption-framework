# Common blockers and challenges to innovation

As described in the [innovate methodology article](./index.md), innovation requires a balance of invention and adoption. This article expands on common challenges and blockers to help establish an understanding of how this approach can add value during your innovation cycles. Formula for innovation: **Innovation = Invention + Adoption**

## Adoption challenges

Cloud technology advances have reduced some of the friction related to adoption.
Unfortunately, adoption is more people centric than technology centric. Sadly, the cloud can't fix people.

The following list elaborates on some of the most common adoption challenges related to innovation. As you progress through the Innovate methodology, each of the challenges in the following sections will be identified and addressed. Before engaging in the methodology, evaluate your current state innovation cycles to determine which are most important challenges or blockers for you. Then use the methodology to address or remove those blockers.

### External challenges

- **Time to market:** In a digital economy, time to market is one of the most crucial leading indicators of market domination. Surprisingly, time to market impact has little to do with positioning or early market share, both are fickle and temporary. The time to market advantage comes from the simple truth that more time on market equates to more time to learn, iterate, and improve. Focus heavily on quick definition and rapid **build** of an effective minimum viable product to shorten time to market (TTM) timelines and accelerate **learning**.
- **Competitive challenges:** Dominant incumbents reduce opportunities to engage and learn from customers. Competitors also create external pressure to deliver more quickly. Build fast. However, invest heavily in understanding proper measures. Well-defined niches produce more actionable feedback _measures_ along with the ability to more closely partner and _learn_, resulting in better overall solutions.
- **Understand your customer:** Customer empathy starts with an understanding of the customer and customer base. One of the biggest challenges for innovators is the ability to rapidly categorize **measurements and learnings** within the build-measure-learn cycles. It is important to understand the customer through the lenses of market segmentation, channels, and types of relationships. Throughout the build-measure-learn cycles, these data points will help create empathy and shape lessons learned.

### Internal challenges

- **Choosing innovation candidates:** When investing in innovation, healthy companies will spawn an endless supply of potential inventions. Many of which will create compelling business cases. Most of them will suggest high returns and lead to enticing business justification spreadsheets. As described in the build article, **building with customer empathy** should be prioritized over invention based only on gain projections. If customer empathy isn't visible in the proposal, then long-term adoption is highly unlikely.
- **Balancing the portfolio:** Most technology implementations focus not on changing the market or improving the lives of customers. In the average IT department, more than 80% of workloads are maintained for basic process automation. With the ease of innovation, it is compelling to innovate and rearchitect those solutions. Most of the times, those workloads can experience similar or better returns by migrating or modernizing the solution, with no change to core business logic or data processes. Balance your portfolio to favor innovation strategies that can be _built_ with clear empathy for the customer (internal or external). For all other workloads, follow a migrate path to financial returns.
- **Maintaining focus and protecting priorities:** When a commitment to innovation has been made, it is important to maintain the team's focus. During the first iteration of a **build** phase, it's relatively easy to keep a team excited about the possibilities of changing the future for your customers. However, that first MVP release is just the beginning. True innovation comes with each build-measure-learn cycle by learning from the feedback loops to produce a better solution. As a leader in any innovation process, the most important contribution you can make is to keep the team focused and protect innovation priorities through the subsequent, less-glamorous **build** iterations.

## Invention challenges

Prior to the widespread adoption of the cloud, invention cycles that depended on information technology where laborious and time consuming. Procurement and provisioning cycles often delayed the crucial first steps toward any new solutions. The cost of DevOps solutions and feedback loops delayed teams' abilities to collaborate on early stage ideation and invention. Costs related to developer environments and data platforms prevented anyone but highly trained professional developers from participating in the creation of new solutions.

The cloud has overcome many of the previous invention challenges by providing self-service automated provisioning, light-weight development and deployment tools, and opportunities for professional developers and citizen developers to cooperate on rapid solutions creation. Leveraging the cloud for innovation dramatically reduces customer challenges and blockers to the invention side of the innovation equation.

### Invention challenges in a digital economy

The invention challenges of today are different. The endless potential of cloud technologies also produces more implementation options and deeper considerations regarding how those implementations could be leveraged.

The Innovate methodology will aid in aligning implementation decisions to the types of invention and adoption you would like to produce along five innovation disciplines:

- **Data platforms:** New sources and variations on data are available. Many of which couldn't be integrated into legacy or on-premises applications to form cost-effective solution. Understanding the change you hope to drive in customers will drive data platform decisions. Those decision will be an extension of selected approaches to ingest, integrate, categorize, and share data. Microsoft refers to this decision making process as the democratization of data.
- **Device interactions:** IoT, mobile, and augmented reality blur the lines between digital and physical, accelerating the digital economy. Understanding the real-world interactions surrounding a customer behavior will drive decisions regarding device integration.
- **Applications:** Applications are no longer the exclusive domain of professional developers. Nor do they require traditional server-based approaches. Empowering professional developers, enabling business specialists to become citizen developers, and expanding compute options for API, micro-services, and PaaS solutions expand application interface options. Understanding the digital experience required to shape a customer behavior will drive decisions regarding the best application options.
- **Source code and deployment:** Both speed to market and quality are delivered by the shared collaboration between developers of all walks. Integration of feedback and rapid response to learning shape market leaders. Commitments regarding build, measure, learn processes will shape adoption acceleration tool decisions.
- **Predictive solutions:** Meeting the current needs of customers is seldom enough in a digital economy. Customers expect businesses to aggregate data in an effort to anticipate their next steps, predict future needs, and influence decisions. Continuous learning often quickly evolves into prediction tooling. Complexity of the customer needs and availability of data will help define the best tools and approaches to predict and influence.

In a digital economy, the greatest challenge architects face is found in the ability to clearly understand the customer need and determine the best cloud-based toolchain to deliver on the invention and adoption needs.

## Next steps

Based on the knowledge gained regarding the build-measure-learn model and growth mindset, you are now ready to [develop digital inventions](./invention.md) within the [innovate methodology](./index.md).
