# Learning with customers

Current customers are the greatest source of learning. They help us [build with customer empathy](./build.md), by partnering to find the best solution to their needs. They also use the MVP solution creating metrics so we can [measure customer impact](./measure.md). In this article, we will outline an approach to learn with those customer partners.

## Continuous learning

At the end of every iteration, we have an opportunity to learn from build and measure cycles. This process of continuous learning is quite simple, see the image below for an overview of the process flow.

In its simplest form, continuous learning is a process for responding to learning metrics and the impact on customer needs. This process consists of three primary decisions to be made at the end of each iteration:

- **Did the hypothesis prove true?** When the answer is yes, celebrate for a moment, then move on. There are always more things to learn, more hypotheses to test, and more ways to help the customer in your next iteration. When a hypothesis proves true, it is often a good time for teams to decide on a new feature to expand the solution's ability to better meet the customer needs.
- **Can you get closer to a validated hypothesis by iterating on the current solution?** This answer is usually yes. Learning metrics will suggest points in the process that lead to customer deviation. Use these data points to find the root of a failed hypothesis. At times, the metrics may also suggest a solution as well.
- **Is a reset of the hypothesis required?** The scariest thing to learn in any iteration is that the hypothesis or underlying need was flawed. When this happens, an iteration alone isn't necessarily the right answer. When a reset is required, the hypothesis should be rewritten and the solution reviewed in light of the new hypothesis. The sooner this type of learning can occur, the easier it will be to pivot. Early hypothesis should focus on testing the riskiest aspects of the solution, in an attempt to avoid pivots later in development.
- **Unsure?** The second most common response after "Iterate" is "We're not sure." Embrace these responses. They are an opportunity to engage the customer to look beyond the data.

The answers to these questions will shape the iteration to follow. Companies who demonstrate an ability to apply continuous learning and boldly make the right decisions for their customers, are more likely to emerge as leaders in their market.

Unfortunately, the practice of continuous learning is an art that requires a great deal of trial and error. In addition to the art, it requires a bit of science and data driven decision making. Perhaps the most difficult part of adopting continuous learning is the cultural requirements. To effectively adopt continuous learning within any adoption methodology, the culture must be open to a fail first, customer focused approach. The following section outlines Microsoft's cultural view, referred to as a Growth Mindset.

## Growth mindset

Few could deny the radical transformation within Microsoft that has occurred over the last several years. Financially, culturally, and globally the transformation, led by Satya Nadella, has been referenced as a surprising business success story. At the heart of this story is a simple belief referred to as a growth mindset. An entire section of this framework could be dedicated to the adoption of a growth mindset. But to relentlessly simplify this guidance, we'll focus on a few key points which should guide the process of learning with customers:

- **Customer first:** If a hypothesis is designed to better the experience of real customers, then meet real customers where they are. Don't just rely on metrics. Compare and analyze metrics based on first hand observation of customer experiences.
- **Continuous learning:** Customer focus and customer empathy stem from a learn-it-all mindset. Innovate by strives to be a learn-it-all, as opposed to a know-it-all.
- **Beginner's mindset:** Demonstrate empathy by approaching every conversation with a beginner's mindset. If you are new to your field or a 30-year veteran, assume you know little and you will learn a lot.
- **Listen more:** Customers want to partner with you. Unfortunately, the desire to be right blocks that partnership. Focus on speaking less and listening more to learn beyond metrics.
- **Encourage others:** Don't just listen, use the things you do say to encourage others. In every meeting, find ways to pull in diverse perspectives from those who may not be quick to share.
- **Share the code:** When we feel our obligation is to the ownership of a code base, we lose sight of the true power of innovation. Focus on owning and driving outcomes for customers. Share your code (publicly with the world or privately with your company) to invite in diverse perspectives to the solution and the code base.
- **Challenge what works:** Success does not mean you are experiencing true customer empathy. Avoid having a fixed mindset or reinforcing the tendency to continue doing what's worked or what you've always done. Look for learning in positive and negative metrics by engaging your customers.
- **Be inclusive:** Work hard to invite in diverse perspectives on an equal plane. There are many things that can divide humans into segregated groups. Cultural norms, past behaviors, gender, religion, sexual preference, even physical abilities. True innovation comes when we challenge ourselves to see past our differences and be inclusive of all customers, partners, and coworkers.
