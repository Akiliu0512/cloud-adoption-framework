# NoSQL migration decision tree

The following decision tree outlines options available for migrating a NoSQL data structure to various data platforms in Azure.
This reference can aid in determining the most appropriate migration path for NoSQL.

## Innovation paths based on this decision tree

Most of the paths in this decision tree lead to a migration of data directly to Azure Cosmos DB, leveraging one of the APIs supported by Cosmos DB. Those solutions are each considered modernized and would be ready to support cloud-native inventions and innovation.

Other paths which lead to infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solutions may require additional extension of the solution to prepare for cloud-native innovations.
