# AI application

Infusing AI into an application can be difficult and time-consuming. Until recently, you needed both a deep understanding of machine learning and months of development to acquire data, train models, and deploy them at scale. Even then, success was not guaranteed. The path was filled with blockers, gotchas, and pitfalls causing teams to fail to realize value from their AI investments.  

Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services remove these challenges and are designed to be productive, enterprise ready, and trusted. They make it possible for you to build on the latest breakthroughs in AI without building and deploying your own models; instead you can deploy AI models using just a few simple lines of code so that even without a large data science team, you can quickly create applications that see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.

Common scenarios for conversational AI or chatbot solutions include:  

- Sentiment Analysis
- Object Detection
- Translation
- Personalization
- Robotic Process Automation

As you get started, the checklist and resources below will help you plan your application development and deployment.

- Are you familiar with the multitude of capabilities and services offered within Azure Cognitive Services, and which ones in particular you will be using?
- Determine whether or not you have custom data with which you want to train and customize these models. There are Cognitive Services that are customizable.
- There are several ways to use Azure Cognitive Services. Explore the quickstart tutorials for getting up and running for both SDK and REST APIs. Note: The Cognitive Services SDKs are available for many popular dev languages, including C#, Python, Java, JavaScript and Go.
- Determine if you will need to deploy these Cognitive Services in containers.

## Checklist

To get started, first familiarize yourself with the various categories and services within Azure Cognitive Services. Visit the product pages to learn more and to interact with demos to learn more about the capabilities available, such as Vision, Speech, Language and Decision. There is also an e-book that walks through common scenarios and how to build your first app with Cognitive Services.
