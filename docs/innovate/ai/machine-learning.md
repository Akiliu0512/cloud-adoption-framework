# Machine Learning

Azure empowers you with the most advanced machine learning capabilities. Quickly and easily build, train, and deploy your machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning. Azure Machine Learning can be used for any kind of machine learning, from classical Machine Learning to deep learning, supervised, and unsupervised learning. Whether you prefer to write Python or R code or zero-code/low-code options such as theÂ [designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score), you can build, train, and track highly accurate machine learning and deep-learning models in an Azure Machine Learning Workspace.

You can even start training on your local machine and then scale out to the cloud. The service also interoperates with popular deep learning and reinforcement open-source tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Ray RLlib.

For more information on getting started with [Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/), visit Azure Machine Learning.  You will find a tutorial on getting [started with your first ML experiment](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup). To learn more about the open source model format and runtime for machine learning, visit the [ONNX documents page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-onnx).

Common scenarios for machine learning solutions include:

- Predictive Maintenance
- Inventory Management
- Fraud Detection
- Demand Forecasting
- Intelligent Recommendations
- Sales Forecasting

## Checklist

**Get started by first familiarize yourself with Azure Machine Learning**, then choose which experience to begin with. You can follow along steps to use a Jupyter notebook with Python, the visual drag and drop experience, automated ML.
