# Conversational AI

Microsoftâ€™s Azure AI platform aims to empower developers to innovate and accelerate their projects.  Specifically for Conversational AI, Azure offers the Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework SDK & tools enabling developers to build rich conversational experiences. Additionally, developers can utilize Azure Cognitive Services (domain-specific AI services available as APIs) like Language Understanding, QnA maker, and Speech to add the abilities for your chatbot to understand and speak with your end-users.  
 
Common scenarios for conversational AI or chatbot solutions include:

- Informational Q&A chatbot
- Customer Service or support chatbot
- IT Helpdesk/ HR chatbot
- e-commerce/ sales chatbot
- Speech-enabled devices

Note: We offer Power Virtual Agents, built on top of the Bot Framework, for developers who want to build a chatbot with a primarily no-code/low-code experience. Additionally, developers neither host the bot themselves, control the natural language or other AI models themselves with Cognitive Services.

## Checklist

Familiarize yourself with Azure Bot Service and Microsoft Bot Framework.

- Bot Framework is open source offering comprised of an SDK (available in C#, JS, Python, and Java) to help you design, build and test your bot. It also offers a free visual authoring canvas in BF Composer, and an testing tool in BF Emulator.
- Azure Bot Service is a dedicated service within Azure that allows you to host or publish your bot in Azure and connect to popular channels.
