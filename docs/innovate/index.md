# Cloud innovation in the Cloud Adoption Framework

Every IT portfolio has a small collection of workloads and ideas that could significantly improve the company's position in the market. While most cloud adoption efforts focus on migration and modernization of existing workloads, the greatest business value derived from cloud adoption comes from innovation activities that unlock new technical skills and expanded business capabilities. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework focuses on the part of the portfolio that drives the greatest return on investment.

## Getting started

To prepare you for this phase of the cloud adoption lifecycle, the framework suggests the following exercises:

                        <div class="cardImageOuter">

                            <h3>Business value consensus</h3>
                            Before deciding on technical solutions, it's important to align the desired business value. That value should map to the cloud strategy. In this incremental methodology, business value is represented by a hypothesis about customer needs.

                            Many cloud native tools available in Azure can accelerate development of innovative solutions. Depending on the customer hypothesis, various combinations of tools may apply. Building a minimum viable product (MVP) with basic tools is suggested.

                            During each development iteration, the solutions under development provide a way for teams to learn alongside customers. Fast and accurate feedback loops with customers help test, measure, and learn to reduce time to market impact. Learn how Azure and GitHub accelerate feedback loops.

## Methodology summary

The [considerations section of the innovate methodology](./considerations/index.md) establishes a common language for innovation across application development, DevOps, IT, and business teams. The exercises above make this methodology actionable during the development of innovative solutions.

![The Innovate methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework](../_images/innovate/innovate-methodology.png)

This methodology builds on existing lean methodologies to create a cloud-focused conversation about customer adoption and a scientific model for the creation of business value. It also aligns existing Azure services with manageable decision processes, making it easier to find the right technical options to address a specific customer need or hypothesis.

## Next steps

The first exercise during cloud innovation is to [build consensus for the business value](./business-value.md).
