# Innovation in the Cloud Adoption Framework

The cloud creates new opportunities for customers to innovate.

> [!NOTE]
> In Q3 2019, the Cloud Adoption Framework will expand to include guidance regarding modernization and cloud-native approaches to driving innovation across the digital estate and application portfolio.

## Application modernization and innovation

Cloud-native apps and data accelerate development and experimentation cycles. Older apps can take advantage of many of the same cloud-native benefits by modernizing the solution or components of the solution. Modern DevOps and SDLC approaches that use cloud technology shorten the time from idea to product change. Combined, these tools invite the customer into the process to create shorter feedback loops and better customer experiences.

## Data platform modernization and innovation

The cloud enables new forms of data within common platforms. Increasing velocity, veracity, variety, and volume of data allows data professionals to develop insights and predictions across broader data sets. Expanded ingression tools, like IoT and Azure Data Factory, allow broader teams to integrate data bidirectionally with physical and virtual products.

## Infrastructure modernization and innovation

Modern approaches to infrastructure deployment, operations, and governance are rapidly bridging the gaps between development and operations. Establishing environment factories with common templates for various application patterns allows IT and operations teams to accelerate deployment while reducing risks. Integration of operations frees DevOps from maintenance of configuration drift, security baseline implementation, operational monitoring, and other IT services. Modernization and innovation in the IT portfolio produces tighter alignment with DevOps, accelerating innovations across the digital estate and application portfolio.

## MS Learn

Microsoft Learn is a new approach to learning. Readiness for the new skills and responsibilities that come with cloud adoption doesn't come easily. Microsoft Learn provides a more rewarding approach to hands-on learning that helps you achieve your goals faster. Earn points and levels, and achieve more!
Here are a couple of examples of tailored learning paths on Microsoft Learn which align to the Innovate portion of the Cloud Adoption Framework:

[Administer containers in Azure](learn/paths/administer-containers-in-azure/):Azure Container Instances are the quickest and easiest way to run containers in Azure. This learning path will teach you how to create and manage your containers, and how ACI can be used to provide elastic scale for Kubernetes.

[Create Serverless Applications](learn/paths/create-serverless-applications/):Azure Functions enable the creation of event driven, compute-on-demand systems that can be triggered by various external events. Learn how to leverage functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures.

To discover additional learning paths, browse the [Learn catalog](/learn/browse). Use the Roles filter to align learning paths with your role.
