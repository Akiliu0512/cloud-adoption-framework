# Cluster and application security

Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes security essentials and review the secure setup for clusters and application security guidance. Kubernetes security is important throughout the container lifecycle because of the distributed, dynamic nature of a Kubernetes cluster. Applications are only as secure as the weakest link in the chain of services that comprise the applicationâ€™s security.

## Plan, train, and proof

As you get started, the security essentials checklist and Kubernetes security resources below will help you plan for cluster operations and application security.  By the end of this section, you'll be able to answer these questions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Have you reviewed the security and threat model of Kubernetes clusters?
> - Is your cluster enabled for Kubernetes role-based access control?

**Familiarize yourself with the security essentials white paper.** The primary goals of a secure Kubernetes environment are ensuring that it protects the applications it runs, that it identifies and addresses security issues quickly, and that it prevents similar issues in the future.

**Setup cluster Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC).** This control mechanism lets you assign users, or groups of users, permission to do things like create or change resources, or view logs from running application services.

## Deploy to production and apply Kubernetes security best practices

As you prepare the application for production, implement a minimum set of best practices. Use this checklist at this stage.  By the end of this section, you'll be able to answer these questions:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Have you set up network security rules for ingress, egress, and intra-pod communication?
> - Is your cluster set up to automatically apply node security updates?
> - Are you running a security scanning solution for your cluster and container services?

**Create a secrets management policy.** Securely deploy and manage sensitive information, like passwords and certificates, using secrets management in Kubernetes.

**Apply security and kernel updates to worker nodes.** Understand the AKS node update experience. To protect your clusters, security updates are automatically applied to Linux nodes in AKS. These updates include OS security fixes or kernel updates. Some of these updates require a node reboot to finish the process.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Can you enforce governance and cluster policies at scale?
