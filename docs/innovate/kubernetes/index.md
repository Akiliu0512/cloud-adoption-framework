# Kubernetes in the Cloud Adoption Framework

To simplify adoption of Kubernetes and cloud-native practices at scale, review a prescriptive framework that includes Kubernetes documentation, resources, tools, programs, and content (best practices, configuration templates, and architecture guidance).

The list of required actions is categorized by persona to drive a successful deployment of applications on Kubernetes, from proof of concept to production, then scaling and optimization.

## Get started

To prepare for this phase of the Kubernetes cloud adoption lifecycle, use the following exercises:

- [Application development and deployment](./application-development.md): Examine patterns and practices of application development, configure continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and implement site reliability engineering (SRE) best practices.
- [Cluster design and operations](./cluster-design-operations.md): Identify for cluster configuration and network design. Ensure future scalability by automating infrastructure provisioning. Maintain high availability by planning for business continuity and disaster recovery.
- [Cluster and application security](./cluster-application-security.md): Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes security essentials. Review the secure setup for clusters and application security guidance.
