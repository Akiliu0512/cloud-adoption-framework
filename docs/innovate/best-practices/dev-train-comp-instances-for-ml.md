# Determine development, training, and compute instances for your machine learning model

When determining development, training, and compute instances for your machine learning model, consider the algorithm that you're using, the data type, data sizes, and if you'll perform distributed training.

## Development and training for your machine learning model

Reference the following diagram to understand development and training for your machine learning model:

## Compute instances for your machine learning model

The following diagram can help you to decide on the appropriate compute instances for your machine learning model to run inference.
