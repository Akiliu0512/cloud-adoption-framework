# Tools to democratize data in Azure

As described in the theory article on [democratizing data](../considerations/data.md), many innovations can be delivered with minimal technical investment. There are countless examples of major innovations that required little more than raw data. Democratizing data is about investing as little as is needed to engage your customers using data to capitalizing on their existing knowledge. Starting with data is a quick way to test a hypothesis before expanding into broader, more costly digital inventions. As more of the hypothesis is refined and the inventions begin to be adopted at scale, the processes below will each aid in preparing for operational support of the innovation.

## Alignment to the methodology

This type of digital invention can be accelerated through each phase of the following process, also pictured above. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left. Those articles have been grouped into the same phases to align guidance with the overall methodology:

- **Share data:** First step of democratizing data is to share openly.
- **Govern data:** Ensure that any sensitive data is secured, tracked, and governed before sharing.
- **Centralize data:** Sometimes it's necessary to provide a centralize platform for data sharing and governance.
- **Collect data:** Migration, integration, ingestion, and virtualization can each collect existing data to be centralized, governed, and shared.

It is advised that cloud adoption teams only go as deep into the stack as is required to prioritize the focus on customer needs over architecture in every iteration. Delaying technical spikes in favor of customer needs will accelerate validation of your hypothesis. As such, all guidance maps to the four processes above from highest customer impact to highest technical impact. Across each, you will encounter guidance on a variety of potential ways that Azure could accelerate your ability to [build with customer empathy](../considerations/build.md).

## Toolchain

In Azure the following tools are commonly leveraged to accelerate digital invention across each of the phases above: Power BI, Azure Data Catalog, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, Cosmos DB, Azure Databases for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL Hyperscale, Azure Data Lake, Azure Data Migration Service, Azure SQL Database (with or without managed instances), Azure Data Factory, Azure Stream Analytics, SQL Server Integration Services, Azure Stack, Azure SQL stretch databases, StorSimple, Azure Files, File Sync, and Polybase.

As the invention approaches adoption at scale, the aspects of each solution will require refinement and technical maturity. As that happens, it is likely that more of these services will be required. For now, use the table of contents to the left to find guidance on Azure tools relevant to the process required to test your hypothesis.

## Get started

The table of contents on the left outlines many articles to get you started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
