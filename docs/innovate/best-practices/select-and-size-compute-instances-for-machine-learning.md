# Select and size compute instances for machine learning

## Development and training for your machine learning model

When measuring and selecting compute instances for developing and training your machine learning model, consider the algorithm that you're using, the data type, data sizes, and if you'll perform distributed training.

Reference the following diagram to understand development and training for your machine learning model:

## Inference for your machine learning model

The following inference diagram can help you to determine compute instances that will help your machine learning model to run inference.
