# Tools to engage via apps in Azure

As described in [Engage via apps](../considerations/apps.md), applications can be an important aspect of an MVP solution. Often, applications are required to test a hypothesis. This article will help get you started on the tools Azure provides to accelerate development of those applications.

## Alignment to the methodology

This type of digital invention can be accelerated through each approach listed below, also pictured above. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left. Those articles have been grouped into the approaches to align guidance with the overall methodology:

For this article, assume that all inventions resulting in an application will stem from a shared solution (described in the [empower adoption](./ci-cd.md) article). Also assume that each application results in some type of customer experience (for an internal or external customer). Based on those assumptions, the following three paths are most common for cloud adoption teams who are developing digital inventions:

- **Citizen developers:** Business subject matter experts choose to use citizen developer tools to rapidly test and validate that a customer hypothesis can meet the needs of the customer, before engaging professional developers.
- **Intelligent experiences:** Create modern experiences using cloud platforms to drive rapid deployment and short feedback loops. Expand on web applications to infuse intelligence or even integrate bots.
- **Cloud-native:** Build a new invention which naturally takes advantage of cloud capabilities.

Each path results in short-term and long-term advantages and disadvantages. When the cloud governance team, the cloud operations team, and the cloud center of excellence team are prepared to support each approach, adoption can be accelerated with minimal impact to sustainable business operations.

## Toolchain

Depending on the path taken by the cloud adoption team, Azure provides tools to accelerate the team's ability to build with customer empathy. The following list of Azure offerings are grouped based on the decision paths above. Those offerings include:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Kubernetes Service
- Azure Migrate
- Azure Stack
- PowerApps
- Microsoft Flow
- Power BI

## Get started

The table of contents on the left outlines many articles to get you started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
