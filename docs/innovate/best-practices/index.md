# Developing digital inventions in Azure

Azure can assist in accelerating the development of each area of digital invention. This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework builds on the [Innovate Methodology](../considerations/index.md) to illustrate how various services in Azure can be leveraged together to create a toolchain for digital invention.

## Alignment to the methodology

There are countless combinations of cloud based tools for digital invention and innovation within Azure. The following article series demonstrates a few of those options, which closely align with the Innovate methodology. The following image provides an overview of how various tools align to each type of innovation.

## Toolchain

For more actionable guidance, start with the overview page related to the type of digital invention required to test your hypothesis, so you can [build with customer empathy](../considerations/build.md). The types of digital invention in this article series are as follows:

- [Democratize data](./data.md): Tools for sharing data to solve information related customer needs
- [Engage via apps](./apps.md): Tools to create apps that engage customers beyond raw data
- [Empower adoption](./ci-cd.md): Tools to accelerate customer adoption through digital support for your build-measure-learn cycles
- [Interact with devices](./devices.md): Tools to create various levels of ambient experience for your customers
- [Predict and influence](./predict.md): Tools for predictive analysis and integration of those outputs into applications
