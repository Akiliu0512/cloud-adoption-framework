# Tools to predict and influence data in Azure

As described in the theory article on [predict and influence](../considerations/predict.md), computers and artificial intelligence are much better at seeing patterns than we are. Using cloud based analytics tools, patterns can be easily detected and applied to your customers' needs resulting in a prediction of the best outcome. When those predictions are integrated back into the customer experience, the prediction can influence your customers' behavior patterns through interactions.

## Alignment to the methodology

This type of digital invention can be accelerated through each phase of the following process, in alignment with the methodology pictured above. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left. Those articles have been grouped into the same phases to align with the methodology:

In the image above, data and insights align with the best practices outlined in the [democratizing data](./data.md) article. As subject matter experts discover insights which may be repeatable, the following three steps can be used to mature those insights:

- **Patterns:** Find and define patterns to create predictive models.
- **Predictions:** Apply the pattern to customer data to predict outcomes based on the model and underlying pattern.
- **Interactions:** Consume the predictions from within an application or data source to drive an interaction with your customer.

## Toolchain

In Azure the following tools are commonly leveraged to accelerate digital invention across each of the phases above: Azure ML, HDInsight, Hadoop R Scaler, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. How each tool helps with each phase of predict and influence is reflected in the guidance in the table of contents to the left.

## Get started

The table of contents on the left outlines many articles to get you started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
