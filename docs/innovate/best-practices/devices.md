# Tools to interact with devices in Azure

As described in the conceptual article on [interacting with devices](../considerations/devices.md), the devices used to interact with a customer depend on the amount of ambient experience required to deliver the customer's need and empower adoption. Speed from the trigger that prompts the customer's need and your solution's ability to meet that need are determining factors in repeat usage. Ambient experiences help accelerate that response time and create a better experience for your customers by embedding your solution in the customers' immediate surroundings.

## Alignment to the methodology

This type of digital invention can be delivered through any of the following levels of ambient experience. These levels align with the methodology as shown in the preceding image. The table of contents on the left side of this page lists technical guidance to accelerate digital invention. Those articles are grouped by level of ambient experience to align with the methodology.

- **Mobile experience:** Mobile apps are commonly part of a customer's surroundings. In some scenarios, a mobile device might provide enough interactivity to make a solution ambient.
- **Mixed reality:** Sometimes a customer's natural surroundings must be altered through mixed reality. Engaging a customer within that mixed reality can provide a form of ambient experience.
- **Integrated reality:** Moving closer to true ambience, integrated reality solutions focus on the use of a customer's physical device to integrate the solution into natural behaviors.
- **Adjusted reality:** When any of the preceding solutions use predictive analysis to provide an interaction with a customer within that customer's natural surroundings, that solution creates the highest form of ambient experience.

## Toolchain

In Azure, you commonly use the following tools to accelerate digital invention across each of the preceding levels of ambient solutions. These tools are grouped based on the amount of experience required to reduce complexity in aligning tools with those experiences.

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Mobile experiences | <li> Azure App Service <li> Power Apps <li> Power Automate <li> Intune |
| Mixed reality | <li> Unity <li> Azure Spatial Anchors <li> HoloLens |
| Integrated reality | <li> Azure IoT Hub <li> Azure Sphere <li> Azure Kinect DK |
| Adjusted reality | <li> IoT cloud to device <li> Azure Digital Twins + HoloLens |

## Get started

The table of contents on the left side of this page outlines many articles. These articles help you get started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
