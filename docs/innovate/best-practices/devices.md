# Tools to interact with devices in Azure

As described in the theory article on [interacting with devices](../considerations/devices.md), the devices used to interact with the customer each depend on the level of ambient experience needed to deliver the customer need and empower adoption. Speed from the trigger prompting the need and your solution's ability to meet the customer need is a determining factor in repeat usage. Ambient experiences help accelerate that response time and create a better experience for your customers, by embedded your solution in the customers' immediate surroundings.

## Alignment to the methodology

This type of digital invention can be delivered through any of the following levels of ambient experience, in alignment with the methodology, as pictured above. Technical guidance to accelerate digital invention is listed in the table of contents on the left. Those articles have been grouped into the same levels of ambient experiences to align with the methodology:

- **Mobile experience:** Mobile apps are commonly a part of the customers' surroundings. In some scenarios, a mobile device may provide a sufficient level of interactivity to make a solution ambient.
- **Mixed reality:** Sometimes a customer's natural surroundings must be altered through mixed reality. Engaging customers within that mixed reality can provide a form of ambient experience.
- **Integrated reality:** Moving closer to true ambience, integrated reality solutions focus on the use of a device which exists within the customer's physical reality to integrate the solution into natural behaviors.
- **Adjusted reality:** When any of the ambient solutions above use predictive analysis to provide an interaction with the customer within their natural surroundings, the solution creates the highest form of ambient experience.

## Toolchain

In Azure the following tools are commonly leveraged to accelerate digital invention across each of the levels of ambient solution above. Those tools have been grouped based on the level of experience required to reduce complexity in aligning tools with required experiences.

- Mobile Experience: App Service, PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, Intune
- Mixed Reality: Unity, Azure Spatial Anchors, HoloLens
- Integrate Reality: Azure IoT Hub, Azure Sphere, Kinect DK
- Adjusted Reality: IoT cloud to device, Digital Twins + HoloLens

## Get started

The table of contents on the left outlines many articles to get you started with each of the tools in this toolchain.
