What should the customer look for before releasing the migrated assets?

Most release processes require a simple DNS change to route traffic to the new assets.
Is there something special about releasing this migration output? Is there a data cut over or some extra step?

## <Insert Scenario Name> post release

Are there specific post-release criteria the customer must follow to be successful?
