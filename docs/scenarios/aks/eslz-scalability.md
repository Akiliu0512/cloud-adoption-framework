# AKS Enterprise-scale Scalability

## Design considerations

Here are some crucial factors to consider:

- Decide to burst from AKS cluster using ACI and Virtal Nodes. Is rapid scalability a requirement (no-time-to-wait)?

- Is scalability infrastructure/VMâ€™s required? Consider Cluster Autoscaling and HPA

- Has scalability with Multi-Zone and Node Pools been considered? 

## Design recommendations

Follow these best practices for your design:

- Use VMSS.  VM scale sets are required for scenarios including autoscaling, multiple node pools, and Windows support.

- If you need fast burst autoscaling enable Virtual nNdes.

- Enable cluster autoscaler per nodepool.
