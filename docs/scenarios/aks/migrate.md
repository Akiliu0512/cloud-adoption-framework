# Migrate Kubernetes and containers

Technology portfolios usually include a mix of innovative and stable state solutions. Most container conversations focus on innovation and building cloud-native applications. But containers can be equally valid in migration efforts.

There is a clear and growing trend of migrating existing workloads from on-premise datacenters to a Kubernetes cluster in Azure. This approach has the potential of reducing the post-migration infrastructure footprint. More importantly, migrating to containers allows for greater portability in the portfolio, allowing workloads to be more easily moved between public and private cloud. This trend is most commonly experience when orgnizations have a large collection of web applications.

## Kubernetes and containers process details

Are there data points outside of a standard Azure Migrate assessment that you need to prepare for migration?

## Kubernetes and containers process flow

Are there Azure migrate partners that can help get the data? What about other 3rd parties?

## Kubernetes and containers workload specific activities

Are there specific criteria for workloads in that portfolio that would require the customer to run a well-architected review for any workloads?

## Next step: Release Kubernetes and containers

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
