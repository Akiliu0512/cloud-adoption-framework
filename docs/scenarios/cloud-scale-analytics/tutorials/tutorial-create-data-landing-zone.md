# Create a data landing zone

A data landing zone is a unit of scale in the enterprise-scale analytics architecture pattern. The benefits of using a data landing zone include regional deployments, clear separation of ownership, cost chargeback, and in-place data sharing within and across zones. You also can scale within a data landing zone by using cross-functional data integration and data product teams. The reference design offers a self-service approach for data product teams to overcome bottlenecks and the need for a central team for cloud service deployments. The data landing zone reference implementation creates a consistent setup inside an Azure subscription. It deploys storage accounts and data processing services like Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Databricks.

## What's deployed?

When you complete the deployment steps described in this tutorial, you deploy a setup in your Azure subscription like the one shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="../images/data-landing-zone.png" border="false" alt-text="Diagram of a data landing zone setup.":::

> [!NOTE]
> Before you deploy the resources described in this tutorial, check the registration status of the required resource providers for your Azure subscription. For more information, see [Resource providers for Azure services](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

A data landing zone deployment uses these Azure services and resources:

- [Azure Virtual Network](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview), including [network security groups](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) and [route tables](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview)
- [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general)
- [Azure Storage Account](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction)
- [Self-hosted integration runtime](/azure/data-factory/create-self-hosted-integration-runtime) (in [Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/))
- [Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-portal) (in [Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/))
- [SQL Server](/sql/sql-server/?view=sql-server-ver15&preserve-view=true)
- [Azure SQL Database](/azure/azure-sql/database/)
- [Synapse workspace](/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-workspace) (in [Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/synapse-analytics/))
- [Azure Databricks](/azure/databricks/)
- [Azure Event Hubs](/azure/event-hubs/)

## Supported regions

Not all services and features are available in all Azure regions. For this tutorial, we recommend that you use the zone-redundant storage replication option for all the central data lakes in your data landing zone. Because zone-redundant storage isn't available in all regions, we limit the regions that are available in the deployment template. If you plan to deploy to a region that's not listed here, change the setting in the corresponding [Bicep](/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) files when you use the template to create a deployment in the Azure portal.

For this tutorial, select one of the Azure regions in the following list:

- (Africa) South Africa North
- (Asia Pacific) Australia East
- (Asia Pacific) Central India
- (Asia Pacific) Japan East
- (Asia Pacific) South India
- (Asia Pacific) Southeast Asia
- (Canada) Canada Central
- (Europe) France Central
- (Europe) Germany West Central
- (Europe) North Europe
- (Europe) UK South
- (Europe) West Europe
- (South America) Brazil South
- (US) Central US
- (US) East US
- (US) East US 2
- (US) South Central US
- (US) West Central 2
- (US) West US 2

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up your deployment, make sure that you meet these prerequisites:

- **Azure subscription**. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

  :::image type="content" source="../images/marketplace-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to search for Azure subscriptions.":::

- **Permissions for the Azure subscription**. You must have the [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) role for the subscription to be able to create a service principal and role assignments for the service principal.

- **Deploy a data management landing zone**. Before you begin, make sure you successfully deploy a [data management landing zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone). The data landing zone relies on Azure Private DNS zones that are deployed when you use the data management landing zone template. If you already have Azure Private DNS zones deployed, you can point to those zones. If you don't have Azure Private DNS zones deployed for the respective Azure services, deployment by using the data landing zone template fails. For more information, see the [data management landing zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone) GitHub repository.

## One-click deployment

1. To deploy a data landing zone, select the **Deploy to Azure** button.

    You can use this option to deploy the data landing zone in your Azure subscription. The deployment template deploys all the resources that are needed to create a data landing zone.

    [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-landing-zone%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-landing-zone%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fportal.dataLandingZone.json)

   Then, the **Cloud-scale Analytics Scenario - Data Landing Zone** customized deployment template opens in the Azure portal.

1. In **Data landing zone**, select or enter the following information:

    | Setting | Action |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Subscription**Â | Select the Azure subscription to use  for the data landing zone deployment. |
    | **Location** | In the dropdown, select an Azure region. If no organizational policies influence the region you choose, it's a good idea to pick a region that's physically close to you. |
    | **Environment** | For this tutorial, select **Development**. |
    | **Data landing zone prefix** | Enter a unique string that's a maximum of 10 alphanumeric characters. The string is a unique prefix that's added to all resource groups and resources in the deployment. |
