# Deploy data product batch via one-click deployment

 If you want to experiment with the resources and see what's deployed as part of data product batch deployment, use the **Deploy to Azure** button. You deploy resources for the data product batch in a data landing zone. The applicable scenarios for data product batch include data product and data integration. As described in previous articles, data products are another unit of scale inside a data landing zone. You can use this template for a data product and data integration into the platform.

To deploy the data product batch using the one-click method, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Deploy to Azure** button. A new page opens in the Azure portal as shown in the following table:

      | Reference implementation   | Description | Deploy to Azure |
      |:---------------------------|:------------|:----------------|
      | Data product batch     | Deploys a data workload template for data batch analysis to a resource group inside a data landing zone. Be sure you deploy a [data management landing zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone) and [data landing zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-landing-zone) first. |[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-product-batch%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-product-batch%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fportal.dataProduct.json) |

1. In the **Data Product** tab, provide the following information:

      | Setting| Suggested Value(s)  |
      |:-------|:--------------------|
      | **Subscription**Â | Select the subscription to deploy the data product to. If you have access to multiple subscriptions, be sure to choose the correct one. |
      | **Resource Group** | Type *dev-dp001* in the field and select the resource group that has the DLZ prefix you created earlier, plus the *-dev-dp001* suffix. |  
      | **Location**| Select the location. If there are no organizational policies influencing the location, it's a good idea to pick a region that's physically close to you. Verify that the region is supported for Enterprise Scale Analytics. A list of supported regions is available in the [data management landing zone overview](/lab1/0_data_management_landing_zone_overview/). Navigate to **Supported Regions**. |
      | **Environment** | We recommend you choose **Development**, for this tutorial. You could use the same process to deploy a test or production environment as well. |
      | **Data Product Prefix** | A prefix added to all the deployed data product resources to make them unique within the subscription. This prefix can be a max of 10 alphanumeric characters. |
