Intro paragraph. Disclose any required dependency on ESLZ design area or other ALZ design areas, with links to those supporting materials.

## Design considerations

- Consider how non-compliance should be detected.
- Consider how to standardize error responses returned by APIs.

## Design recommendations

- Configure diagnostics settings within API Management to output logs and metrics to Azure Monitor.
- Implement an error handling policy at the global level.
- All policies should call <base/>
