# Plan for SAP

Describe how your scenario impacts the adoption plan

## SAP estate

Do you have to look at the existing estate differently? Or is a simple VM to VM migration sufficient?

## SAP adoption plan

Do you have a specific devops backlog the customer should use? Or is the standard adoption plan template still sufficient?
