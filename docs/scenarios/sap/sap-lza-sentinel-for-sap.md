# Microsoft Sentinel for SAP on Azure

This article is part of the "SAP extend and innovate security: Best practices" article series.

- [Microsoft Sentinel for SAP on Azure](./sap-lza-sentinel-for-sap.md)
- [Security operations for SAP on Azure](./sap-lza-security-operations.md)

The sections below outline key design considerations for deploying agents and the solution to protect SAP applications using Microsoft Sentinel. Specifically, the [Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP Applications](/azure/sentinel/sap/deployment-overview).

Consider these prerequisites:

- To collect the data from SAP systems, it's required to deploy a Microsoft Sentinel SAP connector.
- Each SAP SID/Client number combination requires the deployment of a separate connector.

## Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP Applications design considerations

- **Architecture** - SAP topology might include multiple SAP products spread across multiple System IDs, Clients, and instance numbers. Several "front-end" ABAP servers might be present. However, a connection to only one of the ABAP servers is required. Consider connecting to the Message server, which routes the connector to the correct ABAP server to gather data for a given SAP system.

- The Connector is deployed as a docker container on a host VM or physical server. It's currently supported to deploy the connector container on an on-premises machine and on an Azure-based VM. The data connector doesn't support a high availability configuration out-of-the-box. If a High Availability option is required, consider deploying the connector container into a Kubernetes cluster or on Azure Kubernetes Service [Introduction to Azure Kubernetes Service - Azure Kubernetes Service | Microsoft Learn](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)

For step-by-step configuration of AKS, see [Deploying Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for SAP agent into an AKS/Kubernetes cluster](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/deploying-microsoft-sentinel-threat-monitoring-for-sap-agent/ba-p/3528040)

> [!NOTE]
>AKS/Kubernetes deployment is currently the only way to achieve high availability of the data connector.

- When using Kubernetes cluster, It's only supported to have a single data connector fetching data from an SAP system into a single Azure Log Analytics workspace, that is, running multiple pods in Kubernetes cluster connecting to same SAP system and sending data to the same Azure Log Analytics workspace will result in multiple copies of the data being sent, which might cause increased charges for data retention. Consider the increased costs for this scenario.

- While using Docker containers, all the data from an SAP system can go into a single Azure Log analytics workspace.

- The server hosting the connector agents must be able to connect to all ABAP servers from which data retrieval is required. For example, the connector must be able to route and connect to the target ABAP servers using ports outlined in the documentation [Prerequisites for deploying Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAP](/azure/sentinel/sap/prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring#system-prerequisites)

Consider the strategy for alert consumption from Microsoft Sentinelâ€”for example, Teams, email, or Mobile alerts.

- Consider the following when multiple connectors are hosted on a single machine:
  - Container name uses the `sapcon-<sid>` naming pattern, so connecting to multiple systems with the same SID is not possible.
  - If connecting to multiple systems (if different Client ID), use --multi-clients undocumented switch while running the kickstart script. 
This causes the container to be created with the following name `sapcon-<sid>-<client>`.
  - Connecting to multiple systems with the same SID and Client ID (and perhaps a different System Number, or different systems (prod/dev/test)
that use same SID/Client ID/System Nr requires the deployment of the connector on different hosts. Note that Log Analytics data from such systems would be indistinguishable, so when working with systems that have identical SID/Client ID/System Number, it's recommended to use different Log Analytics workspaces to distinguish the data.

## SAP Application Servers design recommendations

- Using an SAP Connector to connect ABAP servers to Sentinel is recommended.
- SAP Connector is recommended to be installed on a separate virtual machine.
- Each SAP system with a unique system ID (SID) will require a separate SAP Connector.
- Ensure that the credentials used are stored in the Key Vault.
- In each SAP system, it's recommended to assign correct Roles and authorizations specific to Sentinel integration to pull the data.
- It's essential to enable SAP Table logging and ABAP logging in SAP systems being monitored.
- We recommend fine-tuning the SAP Connector to avoid short dumps and to pull the right amount of data.
- We recommend implementing an iterative process to fine-tune the alerts in Sentinel to eliminate false positives
  - Example: Allowing select users to run sensitive queries to avoid false positives.

## SAP HANA Database Server design considerations

- Microsoft Sentinel relies on the logs pushed to its workspace by HANA through SYSLOG. No SAP connector is used in this scenario as we use in SAP Application server monitoring.

- To push HANA SYSLOG to Sentinel workspace, Azure Monitoring Agent (Azure Monitor Agent overview - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Learn) is installed in parallel to standard OMS(Operations Management Suite), which pushes data to our telemetry workspace by default. These AMA logs can be directed to the Sentinel Workspace.

- By default, the HANA auditing trail is written to a Database table called CSTABLE. Various functionalities used by the security team (e.g., capture of Firefighter logins) consume the audit logs from the databases. Hence we can't repoint the default logging to SYSLOG. However, we can redirect different audit trails to different targets. Thus, all the Sentinel-related audit policies point to Level "Alert". All "Alert" level logs are directed to SYSLOG with this change.

## Design considerations for Rules in Microsoft Sentinel

- During the analysis and design phase, ensure you do the following:
  - Define scope and use cases
  - Establish criteria for rule identification and prioritization
  - Identify and prioritize the rules for implementation (for example, Critical action, SOX)

- Start with some generally applicable rules, such as:
  - User Creates and uses new user - Identifies a user creating and using other users.
  - Change in a Sensitive Privileged User - Identifies changes of sensitive privileged users.
  - Client Configuration Change - Identifies changes for client configuration such as Client role, Changes recording mode.
  - Deactivation of Security Audit Log - Identifies deactivation of Security Audit Log
  - Sensitive User's Password Change and Log in - Identifies password changes for privileged users.
  - User Unlocks and uses other users - A user unlocked another and then used the other's credentials.
  - Function Module tested - Identifies testing of a function module.
  - Login from an unexpected network - Identifies logons from an unexpected network.
  - Data has Changed during Debugging Activity - Identifies changes for runtime data during a debugging activity.
  - Execution of Sensitive Function Module - Identifies execution of a sensitive ABAP Function Module.
  - Dialog logon attempt from a privileged user - Identifies dialog logon attempts by privileged users on the SAP system.
  - Execution of a Sensitive ABAP Program - Identifies direct execution of a sensitive ABAP program.
  - System Configuration Change - Identifies changes for system configuration.
  - Multiple Logons by User - Identifies logon of the same user from several subnets within a scheduled time interval.
  - Sensitive Tables Direct Access By RFC Logon - Identifies generic table access by RFC logon
  - Transaction is unlocked - Identifies unlocking of a transaction.
  - Sensitive Tables Direct Access By Dialog Logon - Identifies generic table access by dialog logon
  - Security Audit Log Configuration Change - Identifies changes for configuration in Security Audit Log
  - Critical authorizations assignment - New User Assignment - Identifies assignment of a critical authorization object value to a new user.
  - Debugging Activities - Identifies all debugging-related activities.
  - RFC Execution of a Sensitive Function Module- RFC Execution of a Sensitive Function Module
  - Sensitive privileged user makes a change in another user- Identifies changes of sensitive, privileged users in other users.
  - Execution of a Sensitive Transaction Code- Identifies execution of a sensitive Transaction Code
  - Sensitive Privileged User Logged in - Identifies Dialog logon of a sensitive, privileged user.
  - Assignment of a sensitive role- Identifies new assignments for a sensitive role to a user.
  - Assignment of a sensitive profile - Identifies new assignments of a sensitive profile to a user.
  - Brute Force (RFC) - Identifies brute force attacks on the SAP system using RFC logons
  - Multiple Password Changes - Identifies multiple password changes at different levels. 
  - Sensitive Role Changes- Identifies changes in sensitive roles.
  - Multiple Logons by IP- Identifies logon of several users from the same IP within a scheduled time interval.

- Establish a process for reviewing/validating alerts to identify false positives and adjust query logic and watchlist entries accordingly  
- Use Watchlists to correlate data from a data source you provide with the events in your Microsoft Sentinel environment
  - For example, you might create a watchlist with a list of high-value assets, terminated employees, or service accounts in your environment.
  - Existing rules use static watchlists that contain a list of users; however, rules can be authored to provide Sentinel with a refreshable dynamic data source of assets that Sentinel should evaluate.
  - Analytic rules leverage the use of the SAP_USER_CONFIG watchlist. Suppose a particular user or entity generates an excessive number of alerts. In that case, it can be added to the watchlist with tags, such as MassiveLogonsOK, or MassiveRFCOK, to prevent such users from generating noise.

- Use Workbooks that can be used to identify gaps in data & monitor system health
- Use exfiltration rules to monitor data loss; for more information, refer here - [Microsoft Sentinel Solution for SAPÂ® Applications - New data exfiltration detection rules](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/microsoft-sentinel-solution-for-sap-applications-new-data/ba-p/3716881)
