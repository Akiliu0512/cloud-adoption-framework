# Microsoft Sentinel for SAP on Azure

This article is part of the "SAP extend and innovate security: Best practices" article series.

- [Microsoft Sentinel for SAP on Azure](./sap-lza-sentinel-for-sap.md)
- [Security operations for SAP on Azure](./sap-lza-security-operations.md)

This article outline key design considerations for deploying agents and provides the [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications](/azure/sentinel/sap/deployment-overview).

Prerequisites for this scenario:

- To collect the data from SAP systems, you must deploy a Microsoft Sentinel SAP connector.
- You must deploy a separate connector for each SAP security identifier (SID) and client number combination.

## Design considerations

### Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP applications

- **Architecture** - SAP topology might include multiple SAP products spread across multiple system IDs, clients, and instance numbers. The architecture might have several front-end ABAP servers, but only one ABAP server connection is required. Consider connecting to the SAP message server, which routes the connector to the correct ABAP server and gathers data for an SAP system.

- The connector is deployed as a docker container on a host virtual machine (VM) or physical server. It's currently supported to deploy the connector container on an on-premises machine and on an Azure-based VM. The data connector doesn't support an out-of-the-box high-availability configuration. If a high availability option is required, consider deploying the connector container into a Kubernetes cluster or on [Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes).

For step-by-step configuration of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), see [Deploy Microsoft Sentinel Threat Monitoring for an SAP agent into an AKS/Kubernetes cluster](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/deploying-microsoft-sentinel-threat-monitoring-for-sap-agent/ba-p/3528040).

> [!NOTE]
>AKS/Kubernetes deployment is the only way to achieve high availability of the data connector.

- When using Kubernetes cluster, It's only supported to have a single data connector fetching data from an SAP system into a single Log Analytics workspace, that is, running multiple pods in Kubernetes cluster connecting to same SAP system and sending data to the same Log Analytics workspace will result in multiple copies of the data being sent, which might cause increased charges for data retention. Consider the increased costs for this scenario.

- While using Docker containers, all the data from an SAP system can go into a single Log Analytics workspace.

- The server hosting the connector agents must be able to connect to all ABAP servers from which data retrieval is required. For example, the connector must be able to route and connect to the target ABAP servers using ports. For more information, see [Deployment prerequisites for Microsoft Sentinel solutions for SAP](/azure/sentinel/sap/prerequisites-for-deploying-sap-continuous-threat-monitoring#system-prerequisites).

Consider the strategy for alert consumption from Microsoft Sentinelâ€”for example, Teams, email, or Mobile alerts.

- Consider the following when multiple connectors are hosted on a single machine:
  - Container name uses the `sapcon-<sid>` naming pattern, so connecting to multiple systems with the same SID is not possible.
  - If connecting to multiple systems (if different Client ID), use --multi-clients undocumented switch while running the kickstart script.
This causes the container to be created with the following name `sapcon-<sid>-<client>`.
  - Connecting to multiple systems with the same SID and client ID (and perhaps a different system number, or different systems, like production, development, or test, that use same SID/Client ID/System Nr requires the deployment of the connector on different hosts. Note that Log Analytics data from such systems would be indistinguishable, so when working with systems that have identical SID/Client ID/System Number, it's recommended to use different Log Analytics workspaces to distinguish the data.

## SAP application servers

- Use an SAP connector to connect ABAP servers to Microsoft Sentinel.
- SAP Connector is recommended to be installed on a separate virtual machine.
- Each SAP system with a unique system ID (SID) requires a separate SAP connector.
- Store the credentials in Azure Key Vault.
- In each SAP system, it's recommended to assign correct roles and authorizations specific to Microsoft Sentinel integration to pull the data.
- In monitored SAP systems, enable SAP table change logging and ABAP logging.
- We recommend fine-tuning the SAP connector to avoid short dumps and to pull the right amount of data.
- We recommend implementing an iterative process to fine tune the alerts in Microsoft Sentinel to eliminate false positives.
  - Example: Allowing select users to run sensitive queries to avoid false positives.

## SAP HANA database server

- Microsoft Sentinel relies on the logs pushed to its workspace by HANA through SYSLOG. No SAP connector is used in this scenario as we use in SAP application server monitoring.

- To push HANA SYSLOG to Microsoft Sentinel workspace, Azure Monitoring Agent (Azure Monitor Agent overview - Azure Monitor | Microsoft Learn) is installed in parallel to standard OMS(Operations Management Suite), which pushes data to our telemetry workspace by default. These AMA logs can be directed to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

- By default, the HANA auditing trail is written to a database table called CSTABLE. Various functionalities used by the security team (e.g., capture of Firefighter logins) consume the audit logs from the databases. Hence we can't repoint the default logging to SYSLOG. However, we can redirect different audit trails to different targets. Thus, all the Microsoft Sentinel-related audit policies point to Level *Alert*. All *Alert* level logs are directed to SYSLOG with this change.

## Rules in Microsoft Sentinel

During the analysis and design phase, ensure you do the following:
  
- **Review existing rules**: Determine what [build-in analytics rules](/azure/sentinel/sap/sap-solution-security-content#built-in-analytics-rules) exist for SAP and Microsoft Sentinel.
- **Establish scope:** Define the scope and use cases for your situation.
- **Rule criteria:** Establish criteria for rule identification and prioritization.
- **Rule prioritization:** Identify and prioritize the rules for implementation.

Establish a process for reviewing and validating alerts to identify false positives and adjust query logic and watchlist entries accordingly.

- Use watchlists to correlate data from a data source you provide with the events in your Microsoft Sentinel environment.
  - For example, you might create a watchlist with a list of high-value assets, terminated employees, or service accounts in your environment.
  - Existing rules use static watchlists that contain a list of users; however, rules can be authored to provide Microsoft Sentinel with a refreshable dynamic data source of assets that Microsoft Sentinel should evaluate.
  - Analytic rules leverage the use of the SAP_USER_CONFIG watchlist. Suppose a particular user or entity generates an excessive number of alerts. In that case, it can be added to the watchlist with tags, such as MassiveLogonsOK, or MassiveRFCOK, to prevent such users from generating noise.

- Use the [built-in workbooks](/azure/sentinel/sap/sap-solution-security-content#built-in-workbooks) that can be used to identify gaps in data & monitor system health

- Use exfiltration rules to monitor data loss:
