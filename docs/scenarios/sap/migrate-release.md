# Release SAP

Describe how your scenario changes the release and post-release processes during migration in a standard migration factory

## SAP pre-release validation

What should the customer look for before releasing the migrated assets?

## SAP release planning

Should the customer just release all of hte migrated assets to production traffic?
Should they follow release flights? A/B release testing? or some other process specific to their scenario?

## SAP release process

Most release processes require a simple DNS change to route traffic to the new assets.
Is there something special about releasing this migration output? Is there a data cut over or some extra step?

## SAP post release

Are there specific post-release criteria the customer must follow to be successful?

## Next step: Your next migration iteration

Once the SAP migration is complete, the cloud adoption team can begin your next scenario-specific migration. Alternatively, if there are addition platforms to be migrated, this article series can be used again to guide your next SAP migration or deployment.
