# Introduction to an SAP adoption scenario

This series of articles outlines the process for integrating an SAP platform into your cloud adoption efforts.

## Executive summary of SAP on Azure

This series of articles outlines how SAP workloads impact your overall strategy, cloud adoption plan, and environmental readiness efforts, with detailed guidance on common drift for each effort. Once an environment is established, the series explains the processes for migrating an SAP platform and how to use cloud technologies to innovate on that platform. To support your cloud adoption needs, the series also outlines considerations and best practices for managing governance and operations throughout an SAP deployment.

To accelerate these efforts, the articles also include detailed technical resources that describe how to build an enterprise-scale landing zone that can support your mission-critical SAP needs.

## The SAP adoption process

Adopting SAP workloads in the cloud will touch on most of the methodologies and phases within the Cloud Adoption Framework. Distinct constraints within each phase will require actions specific to SAP, and this article series maps standard processes to SAP-specific tasks.
