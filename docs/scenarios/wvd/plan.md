# Windows Virtual Desktop planning

Windows Virtual Desktop and deployment scenarios follow the same Migrate methodology as other migration efforts, allowing migration factories or existing migration teams to adopt the process with little change to non-technical requirements.

Like other migrations, the team will assess workloads, deploy workloads, then release those workloads to end users. However, Windows Virtual Desktop includes specific requirements that will necessitate a review of the Azure landing zones during the assessment of workloads. It will also require a proof of concept prior to the first deployment.

For a reference when building your plan, see the [cloud adoption plan DevOps template](../../plan/template.md) for an existing migration backlog in Azure DevOps. That template can be used to create a detailed plan of activities.

## Next step: Review your environment or Azure landing zones
