# Cost governance for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

Cost governance is the continuous process of implementing policies to control costs of services you are using on Azure. This document will walk you through the various cost governance considerations and recommendations when using Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes.

## How much does Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cost?

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes provides two types of services:

1. Azure Arc control plane functionality, which is provided at no extra cost including:
   - Resource organization through Azure [management groups](/azure/governance/management-groups/overview) and [tags](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources?tabs=json).
   - Searching and indexing through [Azure Resource Graph](/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview).
   - Access control through [Azure role-based access control](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) (RBAC) at subscription or resource group level.
   - Automation through [templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) and [extensions](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/extensions).

2. Azure services used in conjunction with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes (but not limited to), incur costs according to their usage including:
   - [Kubernetes GitOps configuration](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-configurations)
   - [Azure Policy for Kubernetes](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes)
   - [Azure Monitor Container Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview)
   - [Microsoft Defender for Containers](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-introduction?tabs=defender-for-container-arch-aks)
   - [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview)
   - [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts)

>[!Tip]
> Billing for the Azure services used in conjunction with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes is the same as Azure Kubernetes Service billing.
> [!Note]
> If the Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster is on AKS on Azure Stack HCI, then Kubernetes GitOps configuration is included at no charge.

## Design considerations

- **Governance:** Define a governance plan for your hybrid clusters that translates into Azure Policies, tags, naming standards and least-privilege controls.

- **Azure Monitor Container Insights:** [Azure Monitor Container Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview) gives you telemetry visibility by collecting performance metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers that are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API, Container logs are also collected. This is billed by data ingestion, retention, and export for Log Analytics.

- **Microsoft Defender for Cloud:**  Microsoft Defender for Cloud is offered in [two modes](/azure/defender-for-cloud/enhanced-security-features-overview#what-are-the-benefits-of-enabling-enhanced-security-features):

   **Without enhanced security features (Free)** - [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction) is enabled for free on all your Azure subscriptions when you visit the workload protection dashboard in the Azure portal for the first time, or if enabled programmatically via API. Using this free mode provides the secure score and its related features: security policy, continuous security assessment, and actionable security recommendations to help you protect your Azure resources.

   **Microsoft Defender for Cloud with all enhanced security features (Paid)** - Enabling [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/enhanced-security-features-overview) enhanced security extends the capabilities of the free mode to workloads running in private and other public clouds, providing unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid cloud workloads.

- **Kubernetes GitOps configuration:** [Kubernetes GitOps configuration](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/conceptual-configurations) delivers configuration management and application deployment using GitOps. With this capability, cluster admins can declare their cluster configuration and applications in Git. The development teams can then use pull requests and the tools they are familiar with (existing DevOps pipelines, Git, Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts) to easily deploy applications onto Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and make updates in production. Billing is based on the number of vCPUs/hour in the cluster and is charged monthly. Clusters incur a single charge for configuration management no matter how many repositories are connected.

>[!Note]
>Clusters can function without a constant connection to Azure. When disconnected, each cluster’s charge will be determined based on the last known number of vCPUs that were registered with Azure Arc. If your cluster will be disconnected from Azure and you don’t want to be charged for Kubernetes Configuration, you can delete the configurations. The vCPU count is updated every 5 minutes when connected. The first 6 vCPUs are included at no cost.

- **Azure Policy for Kubernetes:** [Azure Policy for Kubernetes](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes) extends Gatekeeper v3, an admission controller webhook for Open Policy Agent (OPA), to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. Azure Policy makes it possible to manage and report on the compliance state of your Kubernetes clusters from one place. There is currently no cost for Azure Policy for Kubernetes while in public preview.

- **Microsoft Sentinel:** [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/overview) provides intelligent security analytics across your enterprise. The data for this analysis is stored in an Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel is billed based on the volume of data ingested for analysis in Azure Sentinel and stored in the Azure Monitor Log Analytics workspace for your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters.

- **Azure Key Vault:** The [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) Provider for Secrets Store CSI Driver allows for the integration of an Azure key vault as a secrets store with a Kubernetes cluster via a CSI volume. Azure Key Vault is billed by the operations performed on the certificates, keys, and secrets.

## Design recommendations

Here are some design recommendations for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cost governance:

### Governance

- Review the recommendations in the [resource organization](./eslz-arc-kubernetes-resource-organization.md) and [governance disciplines](./eslz-arc-kubernetes-governance-disciplines.md) critical design area to implement a governance strategy, organize your resources for better cost control and visibility and use least privilege access model for onboarding and management to avoid unnecessary costs.
### Azure Monitor for Containers

- Review the [Management and monitoring critical design area](./eslz-arc-kubernetes-management-disciplines.md) to plan your monitoring strategy and decide on your requirements for monitoring Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters to optimize your monitoring costs.
- Review [Azure Monitor for Containers pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).
