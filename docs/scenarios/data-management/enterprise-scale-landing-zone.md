# Enterprise-Scale support for 'data management and analytics'
  
<!-- Copying ESLZ Specific implementation references here as a placeholder -->


## Reference Architecture OR Technology Solution

Often Enterprises seek clarity or prescriptive guidance before starting to carve out the technical details for a specific use case, project or an End-to-End Data Analytics & AI platform. This can be a stumbling block as how to ensure that all the strategic principles not only in the scope of current use case but also required for the formulation of the overall Data Strategy are considered.

So, keeping this challenge in view and speed up the delivery of end-to-end insights journey, Microsoft has developed a prescriptive offering in the context of an Enterprise Scale Analytics and AI which marries up perfectly to the key themes discussed above.

Enterprise Scale it is part of Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework which provides prescriptive guidance, coupled with best practices, on cloud operating model, reference architecture and platform templates based on real-world learnings from some of our most challenging, sophisticated, and complex environments. Enterprise Scale Analytics and AI paves the way for customers to build and operationalize something called landing zones to host and run analytics workloads. These landing zones are built on the foundations of security, governance, and compliance yet are scalable and modular, supporting autonomy and innovation.

The Enterprise Scale Analytics and AI architecture was designed with the same strategic principles in mind as mentioned above. To deliver effectively the Enterprise Scale Analytics and AI moves teams from working horizontally across each tier such as Ingest, Processing, Analysis, Consumption and Visualization to vertical Data Landing Zone Groups coexisting together in an agile team. Platform teams such as Data Platform Ops and Platform Ops are grouped together under a common Platform Group.

## Building Blocks

After making all the capability provisions, and taking a principled architectural view as discussed in this section, you will most likely end up with the building blocks required for your cloud strategy journey which may look something like the below:
