# Manage data management

Describe how your scenario changes operations management

## Data management business alignment

Does this scenario require the customer to rethink business alignment or how the platform is supported in operations management?

## Data management operations baseline

Does this workload have special requirements for Visibility, Operational Compliance, or BCDR?

## Data management platform operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the landing zone or platform for this scenario?

## Data management workload operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the individual workloads running on this platform?

## Next step: Your next migration iteration

Once the data management migration is complete, the cloud adoption team can begin your next scenario-specific migration. Alternatively, if there are addition platforms to be migrated, this article series can be used again to guide your next data management migration or deployment.
