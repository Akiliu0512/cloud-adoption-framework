# Roles and Responsibilities

Post defining your cloud-analytics strategy, the next stage is working how to organize team to successfully deliver on your strategy. This section aims to clarify some of the roles and responsiblities you should consider for cloud-scale analytics. These roles and responsilbites can then be mapped into the teams which have been described in previous sections.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section highlights potential roles and responsibilities but isn't an complete list. It is recommended that you consider the guidance but alter it for what works within your organization. Small organizations might not have these roles resourced but it shouldn't prohibit you from deployment of a cloud-scale analytics platform. Large organization might decide to streamline and consolidate roles.

## Roles

Multiple roles are involved a cloud-scale analytics deployment. The table below explains the role, job title and reponsibilities for cloud-scale analytics.
