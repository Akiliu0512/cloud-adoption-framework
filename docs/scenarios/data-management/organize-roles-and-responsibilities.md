# Roles and Responsibilities

Post defining your cloud-analytics strategy, the next stage is working how to organize team to successfully deliver on your strategy. This section aims to clarify some of the roles and responsiblities you should consider for cloud-scale analytics. These roles and responsilbites can then be mapped into the teams which have been described in previous sections.

## Roles

Multiple roles are involved a cloud-scale analytics deployment. The table below explains the role, job title and reponsibilities for cloud-scale analytics.

## Roles and Responsiliblities Matrix

Learning from multiple deployments of cloud-scale analytics it is recommended you develope your own RACI (Responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) matrix. The maxtrix below aims to get you started whilst understanding that the size of your organisation could lead to one person taking on multiple roles to achieve success.
