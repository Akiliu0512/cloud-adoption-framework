# Enterprise enrollment and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants for a "data management and analytics" enterprise-scale scenario

Azure landing zones for "data management and analytics" don't have any considerations or recommendations that affect enterprise enrollment or Azure AD tenant decisions.

However, it's important to understand the decisions made by the cloud platform team, and to be aware of existing [enterprise enrollment or Azure AD tenant decisions](../../ready/enterprise-scale/enterprise-enrollment-and-azure-ad-tenants.md).

Review [identity and access management considerations](eslz-identity-and-access-management.md). These considerations can help you understand how the Azure AD tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You can also evaluate the [resource organization considerations](eslz-resource-organization.md) to understand how the enrollment might be organized into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
