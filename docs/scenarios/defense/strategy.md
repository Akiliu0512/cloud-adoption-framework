# Strategy for defense cloud adoption

## Align with defense strategy

The cloud is a force multiplier for defense scenarios, and many defense organizations have an overarching cloud strategy to incorporate cloud capabilities. It’s important that your cloud strategy aligns with broader initiatives. Otherwise, you risk creating a patchwork system that perpetuates the incompatibility of on-premises environments. However, if you need to rework portions of your environment, the cloud is the perfect environment for refactoring and rationalization. You don’t have to acquire, provision, or retire hardware, and the on-demand access to cloud virtualization increases the speed of workload rationalization and refactoring at a fraction of the cost.

**Know the broader cloud strategy** - We recommend you read all cloud strategy documents published in your chain of command. The publications should align. New terminology and advances in technology can make publications appear out of sync. Crosscheck and get clarification on the future vision.

**Understand the data strategy** – The cloud transforms how you deal with data in defense scenarios. Defense organizations have some of the greatest data demands and create data strategies to account for this complexity. The broader strategy should inform your cloud strategy because it affects how you architect your data solutions. Again, the goal is awareness and compatibility. You need to be aware of any broader data strategy and let that inform your decisions.

**Identify stakeholders** - Identifying and collaborating with stakeholders is essential in defense organizations. The cloud adoption journey creates dependencies. The structure of your defense organization determines the dependencies, but it’s likely you’ll have stakeholders in different branches and agencies that have different ideas of success and alternative priorities. Sign-off and approval is slower in defense environments because everyone is responsible for mitigating risk. The identification of all stakeholders and engagement with them early is key to achieving your cloud adoption goal within your target dates.

There are some practical steps you can take when identifying stakeholders:

- *Create a RACI chart of stakeholders* - RACI charts ensure you identify all stakeholders and know how to involvement them role in the cloud adoption process.
- *Identify Data Owners and Data Stewards* - Data owners and data stewards will be important stakeholders in your cloud adoption journey. You should identify and collaborate with both as early as possible.
- *Identify App Owners* - Application owners control applications and might have a separate roadmap for their application. You need to develop a strategy that supports the mission objectives of application owners.

## Next step

The next step is to create a plan that executes your cloud adoption strategy.
