# Defense cloud adoption framework

The CAF Defense scenario is a cloud adoption framework tailored for defense organizations. The content focuses on the challenges that many defense mission owners face in cloud adoption and offers recommendations to navigate those challenges. The goal of this framework is to accelerate the digital transformation efforts of defense organizations.

Weâ€™ve divided the defense cloud adoption framework into three phases. The phases are mission, platform, and workload. The defense framework helps ensure you reach the objective in each phase of your cloud adoption journey:

## Mission

The mission phase focuses on preparing your organization for cloud adoption. Itâ€™s where you define mission goals and plot a roadmap to achieve those goals. Organization is about ensuring you have the right people to develop, execute, and maintain your cloud solution.

## Platform

The platform phase focuses on establishing a foundation for your defense workloads to run in the cloud. We recommend using a cloud broker to build and maintain the platform. They establish connectivity, identity, and governance for the defense platform.

## Workload

The workload phase focuses on the cyclical process of adopting cloud technologies then securing and managing your defense workloads. Whether you are migrating an application or rethinking that app and using cloud native services to innovate, you will need to make architectural decisions that connect to your mission objectives.

## Next step

Strategy alignment is the first step in cloud adoption for a defense organization.
