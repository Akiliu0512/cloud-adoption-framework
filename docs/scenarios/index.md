# Cloud adoption scenarios

The following scenarios unify technical and nontechnical considerations that your organization can use to accelerate its overall cloud adoption journey.

These scenarios present key sets of guidance that you can use to focus on your requirements. These requirements can help you maximize your cloud investment. The scenarios include pointed guidance across several areas of cloud adoption best practices from the holistic and modular guidance of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF). The workload-specific architectural guidance of the Azure Well-Architected Framework contains reference architectures and example scenarios with deployment templates to implement solutions. These solutions are based on extensive customer experiences that represent an infrastructure your organization can rely on.

Learn and benefit from a repository of successful cloud adoption experiences and best practices guidance. We collected and codified this guidance from across the Microsoft customer and partner ecosystem. Learn from successful migration and modernization experiences across our customer and partner communities to make the cloud yours.
