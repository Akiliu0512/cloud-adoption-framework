# Migrate to Azure with Azure VMware Solution

Azure VMware Solution gives you options when migrating to Azure. “Lifting and shifting” the VMware technology stack to a dedicated cloud environment on Azure can reduce complexity, impacts to business continuity, and the time required for migration. Moreover, it enables the business to adopt cloud technology at a pace that best suits your requirements, expanding to more cloud services over time.

## Microsoft Azure VMWare Solution

Azure VMware Solution is a first party Microsoft Azure service, built with VMware, that delivers a familiar vSphere-based, single-tenant, private cloud on Azure. A VMware technology stack including vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN and HCX, runs natively on dedicated infrastructure within Azure data centers, giving a consistent experience to on-premises VMware environments. Customers can stand up the environment in hours and quickly migrate VM resources. Microsoft operates and supports the Azure VMware Solution environment, and all the necessary networking, storage and management services. 


## Common customer journeys

- **Azure Migration for VMware workloads:** Cloud migration is a focus for almost all organizations in some way, and often the driving force behind the timeline for migration is a need to exit a data center quickly and/or need to scale exiting business capabilities beyond current infrastructure. However, how an organization chooses to approach the migration can vary significantly. For many large businesses with existing VMware investments the ability to maintain operational consistency for their VMware environment in Azure is paramount.
- **Extending hybrid and multicloud agility:** Hybrid VMware architectures are one of the most common configurations we see customers looking for when adopting Azure VMware Solution. Organizations are looking to gain agility between on-premises resources and cloud resources by extending VMware vSphere-based environments to Azure. Hybrid and multi cloud capabilities enable consistency of resource management across on-premises and cloud environments, and the added benefit of connecting and modernize through other Azure services.
- **Benefits of cost optimization for licensing and billing:** Often a large consideration for customers in their migration journey is how to best leverage their on-premises licensing and billing, in the cloud. Microsoft offers Azure Hybrid Benefits, as well as Extended Security Updates, for certain versions of Windows Server and SQL Server, and these benefits are extended to Azure VMware Solution too. With a large portion of VMware workloads running on Windows Server and SQL Server, customers are recognizing the mobility of these licenses as an efficient way to reduce the economic impact of a cloud migration project. With centralized billing and support on Azure VMware Solution, simplifies the tracking and management of cloud spend. 
- **Developing cloud skilling:** An organizations’ IT team has a great deal of expertise across on-premises systems like VMware. With the addition of cloud, many of these roles need retraining and additional process improvements to adopt and manage new technologies. Developing these cloud competencies can be a significant investment in time and resources for any business. Because Azure VMware Solution provides consistency with how VMware resources are managed on premises, there is little to no change required. Additionally, through a seamless connection to other Azure services, such as Azure storage solutions, Azure hybrid identity, monitoring and security services, organizations can incrementally grow competencies in cloud-related skills.
