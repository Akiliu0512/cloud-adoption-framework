## Planning considerations for an initial AI adoption budget

To be successful with adopting AI, you need to plan and estimate the required budget. This includes the costs for acquiring the necessary skills, tools, and the costs for maintaining the AI solutions. If you have a clear financial commitment to AI as a strategic priority, planning for a budget becomes easier.

**Recommendations:**

- **Initial budget**: Establish a dedicated budget for AI adoption, factoring in all associated costs you can map out. Consider this your initial boilerplate template for financial planning. Treat your AI adoption budget as a strategic investment in your organization's strategic growth.
- **Regular reviews**: Regularly review and update your budget to reflect changes in your AI adoption strategy, the skills you need, and the tools you use.
- **Invest in the right people**: Invest in your people by providing them with the necessary training and resources to succeed in your AI initiatives, and invest in hiring the right people with experience that maps to your strategic AI objectives.
