# Business justification and goals for generative AI

To establish a generative AI vision and strategy, there are some key considerations to keep in mind. This guidance will help you understand the potential benefits of generative AI, define your ambition, and establish a decision-making process.

## Business justification

To drive the adoption of generative AI in your organization, you need to understand the potential benefits and how they align with your business goals.

Setting clear objectives and goals and having a clear way to measure success is important to ensure a successful adoption of generative AI, both short term and long term.

In this section, we'll explore some common business goals and how they can be linked to generative AI investments. Use this as a template of examples to help you define your own business goals and success metrics for adopting AI.

### Define goals

Define why you're adopting generative AI and what you hope to achieve. Break down your goals into smaller, measurable objectives if necessary, and exemplify how they can be measured and achieved by defining success metrics.

#### Example goals

|Goal|AI benefit|Examples|
|----|---------------------|---------|
|**Increase customer satisfaction (CSAT) ratings** | Help serve customers faster with a higher quality and better consistency. Perform customer research and analytics. | - Customer chat bots <br> - Customer service automation <br>- Virtual customer assistants |
|**Increase employee productivity**| Shift focus from repetitive and basic tasks to more impactful and strategic work | - Content generation<br> - Code generation <br> - Task management <br> - Easier information searching/retrieval |
|**Increase operational efficiency** | Optimize processes and reduce time and resource wastage. | - Process automation<br> - Predictive maintenance<br> - Workflow automation |
|**Increase revenue** | New business initiatives enabled by AI. | - New product lines or services<br> - Customer and behavior analytics <br> - Upselling products and services |
|**Reduce operational costs**| Automate routine tasks, optimize resource allocation, and streamline processes. | - Predictive maintenance using AI algorithms <br> - Supply chain optimization <br> - Automated data entry and processing |
|**Improve product quality**| Enhance quality control, identify defects, and optimize production processes. | - AI-driven quality inspection systems <br> - Predictive analytics for product defects <br> - Process optimization using AI <br> - Automated testing and validation <br> - Real-time monitoring and adjustments in manufacturing |

### Define success metrics

To measure your goals, you need to define success metrics for each goal. Ensure you can map each individual objective or goal to one or more success metrics that can be measured easily. For example, if you are working according to an OKR model, you might have a few key results for each objective.

#### Example success metrics

| Goal | Success metric examples |
| ---- | -------------- |
| **Increase customer satisfaction** | - Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)<br> - Net Promoter Score (NPS)<br> - Customer retention rate |
| **Increase employee productivity** | - Employee efficiency ratio<br> - Task completion time<br> - Employee satisfaction survey results |
| **Increase operational efficiency** | - Process cycle time<br> - Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)<br> - Workflow completion rate |
| **Increase revenue** | - Revenue growth rate<br> - Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)<br> - Conversion rate |
| **Reduce costs** | - Cost reduction percentage<br> - Cost per unit<br> - [Operating expense (OPEX) and Capital expense (CAPEX) ratio](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/financial-considerations/#capex-to-opex) |
| **Improve product quality** | - Defect rate<br> - Customer complaints<br> - Quality Assurance (QA) score |

## Leadership and organizational readiness

Be proactive in removing any barriers to adoption and ensure that your leadership is aligned with your vision and strategy for generative AI.

Consider asking yourself this:

- How well aligned is your **leadership**, **organization**, and **employees** with your vision and strategy for generative AI?

### Leadership buy-in

You've identified the potential benefits of generative AI and have a clear vision and strategy. Now you need to ensure that your leadership is aligned to that vision and strategy.

> From [The AI Strategy Roadmap: Navigating the stages of value creation](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/04/03/the-ai-strategy-roadmap-navigating-the-stages-of-value-creation/)

Consider the importance of getting early buy-in from stakeholders and leadership to ensure the success of your generative AI initiatives.

**Recommendations:**

- **Consider AI in decision-making**
  - Regularly communicate the strategic importance of AI to the entire organization.
  - Integrate AI into strategic planning and decision-making processes.
  - See [how AI will transform decision-making](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/how-artificial-intelligence-will-transform-decision-making/).
- **Bring visibility to successful AI projects**
  - Showcase successful AI projects to underscore its value to leadership.
  - See [customer stories for Artificial Intelligence](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=&ff=story_product_categories%26%3EArtificial%20Intelligence&p=0&so=cam_rank%20desc).
- **Drive an innovate culture**
  - Continuous learning helps drive AI innovation. See [Continuous learning](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/considerations/learn#continuous-learning).

### Organizational alignment

> "**As organizations realize greater value from AI, they tend to increase their focus on growth**"
> From [The AI Strategy Roadmap: Navigating the stages of value creation](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/04/03/the-ai-strategy-roadmap-navigating-the-stages-of-value-creation/)

A leader-stage company is typically characterized by the existence of a well-defined, comprehensive and future-proof strategy. This strategy is not only clear and specific, but also fully integrated into the broader business strategy. It specifies how AI technologies are intended to support and enhance business objectives, ensuring that all AI initiatives are aligned with, and contribute to, the overarching goals of the organization.

Consider the importance of organizational alignment:

- **Communicate the AI strategy**
  - Communicate the strategy and vision as an integral part of the overall business strategy.
  - Articulate how AI can support and enhance specific business objectives.
  - See [Building a foundation for AI success: Business strategy](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/01/building-a-foundation-for-ai-success-business-strategy/)
- **Review and realign**
  - Regularly review and update the strategy as necessary to reflect changes in business objectives or advancements in AI technology.
- **Measure effectiveness**
  - Drive toward implementing tools and processes to measure the effectiveness of AI initiatives in achieving the business objectives, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of the strategy.
  - If you can measure the effectiveness of your AI initiatives, you can better understand the value they bring to your organization, and get wider buy-in from stakeholders.

### Encourage an adaptable strategy

With the fact-paced evolution of AI technologies, it's important to establish an adaptable AI strategy that can evolve with the technology and the business needs. This strategy should be aligned with the overall business strategy and should be able to adapt to changes in the business environment.

**Recommendations:**

- **Review regularly**: Regularly review and update the AI strategy to reflect changes in business objectives or advancements in AI technology. Don't treat the AI strategy as a one-time project, but as an ongoing process.
- **Capture data**: Analyze data from ongoing and past AI implementations to ensure continuous alignment to business objectives. Refine the business strategy based on the insights gained from the past AI implementations.
- **Prepare for pivots**: Be prepared to pivot the AI strategy based on the insights gained from the data analysis. Be open to changing the strategy if the data suggests that the current strategy is not aligned with the business objectives.
- **Stay informed**: Stay informed about the latest AI technologies and trends. Be prepared to incorporate new technologies into the AI strategy if they align with the business objectives.
- **Feedback mechanism**: Develop a robust feedback mechanism to learn from the successes and failures in AI implementations with full transparency. Use those learnings to continuously invest in skilling, refining the AI strategy, and improving the business outcomes.
