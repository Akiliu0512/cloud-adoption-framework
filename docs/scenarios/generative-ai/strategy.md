# Strategic considerations for adopting generative AI in Azure

To establish a generative AI vision and strategy, there are some key considerations to keep in mind. This guidance will help you understand the potential benefits of generative AI, define your ambition, and establish a decision-making process.

## Determine business impact

### Generative AI impact on your industry

- Determine the impact on your industry and how generative AI can be used to drive innovation and transformation.

### Adapt and learn

Ensuring that your organization is ready to adapt and learn from the potential of generative AI is key to success.

- Incorporate feedback mechanisms to constantly refine and improve your generative AI initiatives.
- What will change for employees?
- What will change for customers?

### Change management and communication

- How much consideration do you give to cultural fit and change management skills when hiring for AI roles, given the significant changes that AI can introduce?
- To what extent does your AI strategy take into consideration the impact of AI on your organization's employees and their roles?
- To what extent is your organization open to the changes that AI adoption may bring to existing processes and workflows?
- How are changes from adopting generative AI communicated (change communication/change management)
- How effectively is the AI strategy and its benefits communicated across all levels of the organization?

### Foster a positive culture

- How much does your organization encourage innovation and experimentation, even if it involves risk of failure?
- How supportive is your leadership in driving the AI adoption initiative within the organization?

## Business justification

### Leadership buy-in

- Does leadership understand the value of GAI?
- How committed is your leadership to the adoption of GAI?
- How clear is your vision or strategy for generative AI, and does your leadership understand it?
- Ensure you map out the budgets and resources needed to support your generative AI strategy, and anchor that in the vision and strategy.
- Can you communicate use cases clearly to your leadership?

## Generative AI business goals

To drive the adoption of generative AI in your organization, you need to understand the potential benefits and how they align with your business goals.

Setting clear objectives and goals and having a clear way to measure success is important to ensure a successful adoption of generative AI, both short term and long term.

### Define your ambition

- What do you want this technology to do? Generally speaking.
- What do you NOT want this technology to do? Generally speaking.

### Define goals

Define why you're adopting generative AI and what you hope to achieve.

Here's a list of example goals:

|Goal|Generative AI benefit|Use cases|
|----|---------------------|---------|
|Increase customer satisfaction|TBD|TBD|
|Increase employee productivity|TBD|TBD|
|Increase operational efficiency|TBD|TBD|
|Increase revenue|TBD|TBD|
|Reduce costs|TBD|TBD|
|Improve product quality|TBD|TBD|

### Define example use cases and value propositions

### Define success metrics

To measure your goals, you need to define success metrics for each goal. Ensure you can map each individual objective or goal to one or more success metrics that can be measured easily. For example, if you are working according to an OKR model, you might have a few key results for each objective.

|Goal|Success metric|
|----|--------------|
|Increase customer satisfaction|TBD|
|Increase employee productivity|TBD|
|Increase operational efficiency|TBD|
|Increase revenue|TBD|
|Reduce costs|TBD|
|Improve product quality|TBD|
