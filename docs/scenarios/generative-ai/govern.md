# Governing generative AI in Azure

## Risk management

Risks are associated with all areas of business. With generative AI, there are new risks to consider. While there are many risk areas, we'll focus on a few examples:

- Regulatory risks
- Reputational risks
- Competency risks
- Financial risks

### Example risks

|Risk area|Example risks|
|---------|-------------|
|Regulatory risk|Non-compliance with legal and regulatory considerations for generative AI in your industry or region.|
|Reputational risk|Negative public perception of your organization's use of generative AI.|
|Competency risk|Lack of skills and knowledge to effectively manage generative AI in your organization.|
|Financial risk|Unforeseen costs associated with generative AI adoption.|

## Additional risk considerations

- To what extent you have a plan to manage potential risks associated with AI (e.g., data security, privacy, ethical considerations)?
- How comprehensive is your plan to address potential risks and challenges related to AI adoption?
- How effective is your data governance framework in managing data access, usage, privacy, and security?
- How often do you audit your data management practices for quality and compliance?

## Recommended policies

- To what extent do your policies ensure the privacy and security of the data used in your AI systems?
