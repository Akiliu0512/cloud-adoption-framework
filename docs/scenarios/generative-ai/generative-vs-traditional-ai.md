# Generative vs. Traditional AI

## Traditional AI

- Enhanced productivity, etc. Also sometimes known as "Everyday AI".

The type of AI used to detect and classify, work on vast amounts of data, operate in real-time applications and help with automation of capabilities is commonly known as traditional AI.

Here are some examples of traditional AI:

| Type                    | Example areas                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning** <br>Teaching machines to learn from data.|- Reinforcement <br> - Supervised Learning <br> - Knowledge Learning <br> - Probabilistic Models <br> - Neural networks       |
| **Natural Language Processing**<br>Understand and generate human language. | - Information extraction <br> - Sentiment analysis <br> - Speech recognition <br> - Machine translation <br> - Large Language Models (including ChatGPT) |
| **Robotics**<br>Controlling objects in the physical world.| - Perception <br> - Actuation <br> - Locomotion <br> - Navigation <br> - Mapping localization <br> - Manipulation and grasping |
| **Reasoning**<br>Making informed decisions.| - Knowledge engineering <br> - Planning and scheduling <br> - Learning and adaptation <br> - Explanation and justification <br> - Real world planning |
| **Object Recognition**<br>Recognizing objects in images or video. | - Image processing <br> - Feature extraction <br> - Object detection <br> - Classification <br> - 3D reconstruction <br> - Motion, shading, contour analysis <br> - Scene understanding |
| **Problem solving**<br>Process of finding a solution.| - Search and exploration <br> - Heuristics <br> - Optimization techniques <br> - Uncertainty handling <br> - Constraint analysis <br> - Evolutionary algorithms <br> - Fuzzy logic |

## Generative AI

With Generative AI (GAI) we typically mean AI that understands and creates content, such as GPT. It works on relatively small chunks of data - text, images, sounds, videos - and has a "liguistic" understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of GAI and the term is often used as a synonym, but LLMs are ones that work on text.

Here are some examples of generative AI:

- **OpenAI**: Ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.

## Decision considerations

When deciding between traditional AI and generative AI, consider the following:

- How How would you rate your organization's ability to develop or procure AI models?
