For your generative AI business scenarios, define the required skills across your leadership, technical teams, and end users.

Consider these important key points to include in your skilling plan:

- **Readiness plan**: Build on the premise of creating a new skills readiness plan and [capture concerns, identify gaps, and partner across teams](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes#partner-across-teams).
- **Identify existing skills**: You should identify the skills that your organization already has. Map these to functions, roles, or teams to build an understanding where you have the strengths and weaknesses in generative AI experience and skills.
- **Identify gaps in skills**: You should identify the skills that you need to acquire. See the recommended learning resources at the end of this article.
- **Measure success**
  - Define ways to keep your organization's skills up to date regularly.
  - Define a way to measure the effectiveness of your skills readiness plan.
