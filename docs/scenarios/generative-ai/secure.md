# Securing generative AI in Azure

## Shared responsibility

Much like the traditional [shared responsibility model in the cloud](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility), AI in Azure also follows an [AI shared responsibility model](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai). This model defines the responsibilities of Microsoft and the customer in securing the AI services and data.
