# Generative AI adoption in Azure

In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern business, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force, revolutionizing industries and reshaping how organizations operate.

Microsoft stands at the forefront of this AI revolution, empowering businesses to harness the potential of AI and drive innovation like never before through the capabilities in Azure.

In this Cloud Adoption Framework scenario, we delve into the fundamental aspects of AI, how AI fuels and drives innovation, explore Microsoft's visionary narrative, and shed light on how Azure's cutting-edge capabilities help unlock remarkable business outcomes.

## What is Generative AI?

## Defining AI

At its core, AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks encompass a spectrum of activities, from recognizing patterns and making predictions to problem-solving and decision-making.

AI is a platform upon which many applications can be built. There are several definitions of technologies within the overarching AI capability, each one has a specific purpose, but together they make up a powerful system. Today, we talk about two generations of AI. The first generation is what we call "Traditional AI" and the second generation is what we call "Generative AI".

### Traditional AI

The type of AI used to detect and classify, work on vast amounts of data, operate in real-time applications and help with automation of capabilities is commonly known as traditional AI.

Here are some examples of traditional AI:

| Type                    | Example areas                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning** <br>Teaching machines to learn from data.|- Reinforcement <br> - Supervised Learning <br> - Knowledge Learning <br> - Probabilistic Models <br> - Neural networks       |
| **Natural Language Processing**<br>Understand and generate human language. | - Information extraction <br> - Sentiment analysis <br> - Speech recognition <br> - Machine translation <br> - Large Language Models (including ChatGPT) |
| **Robotics**<br>Controlling objects in the physical world.| - Perception <br> - Actuation <br> - Locomotion <br> - Navigation <br> - Mapping localization <br> - Manipulation and grasping |
| **Reasoning**<br>Making informed decisions.| - Knowledge engineering <br> - Planning and scheduling <br> - Learning and adaptation <br> - Explanation and justification <br> - Real world planning |
| **Object Recognition**<br>Recognizing objects in images or video. | - Image processing <br> - Feature extraction <br> - Object detection <br> - Classification <br> - 3D reconstruction <br> - Motion, shading, contour analysis <br> - Scene understanding |
| **Problem solving**<br>Process of finding a solution.| - Search and exploration <br> - Heuristics <br> - Optimization techniques <br> - Uncertainty handling <br> - Constraint analysis <br> - Evolutionary algorithms <br> - Fuzzy logic |

### Generative AI

With Generative AI (GAI) we typically mean AI that understands and creates content, such as GPT. It works on relatively small chunks of data - text, images, sounds, videos - and has a "liguistic" understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of GAI and the term is often used as a synonym, but LLMs are ones that work on text.

Here are some examples of generative AI:

- **OpenAI**: Ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.

### Understanding Buy vs. Build

When it comes to AI, there are two primary ways to get started: Buy or Build. The decision to buy or build AI capabilities depends on the organization's unique needs, resources, and strategic goals.

#### Buy

Buying AI capabilities involves leveraging pre-built AI services and solutions from third-party vendors, such as Microsoft. This approach is ideal for organizations that want to quickly and cost-effectively integrate AI into their operations without the need for extensive in-house expertise.

#### Build

Building AI capabilities involves developing custom AI solutions in-house. This approach is ideal for organizations that have unique AI requirements, a dedicated team of data scientists and developers, and the resources to invest in AI development.

## Why is this important?

### The importance of AI for businesses

In today's competitive landscape, businesses that embrace AI can gain a significant edge. AI can help companies to:

- **Enhance decision making**: AI-driven insights derived from data analytics enable more informed, data-driven decision-making, reducing uncertainty and mitigating risks.
- **Drive innovation**: AI fosters innovation by enabling the creation of new products, services, and business models that were previously unimaginable or hard to reach.
- **Improve customer experiences**: AI-powered personalization and recommendation systems enhance customer interactions, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Optimize operations**: AI-driven automation streamlines processes, reduces inefficiencies, and enhances operational agility.
- **Predict and prevent**: AI's predictive and anomaly detection capabilities help businesses anticipate trends, identify potential issues, and take proactive measures.
