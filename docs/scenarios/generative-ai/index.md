# Generative AI adoption in Azure

In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern business, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force, revolutionizing industries and reshaping how organizations operate.

Microsoft stands at the forefront of this AI revolution, empowering businesses to harness the potential of AI and drive innovation like never before through the capabilities in Azure.

In this Cloud Adoption Framework scenario, we delve into the fundamental aspects of AI, how AI fuels and drives innovation, explore Microsoft's visionary narrative, and shed light on how Azure's cutting-edge capabilities help unlock remarkable business outcomes.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a type of AI that can generate content, such as text, images, sounds, and videos. It is a subset of AI that focuses on understanding and creating content, as opposed to traditional AI, which focuses on detecting and classifying content.

### Generative AI vs. Traditional AI

#### Traditional AI

The type of AI used to detect and classify, work on vast amounts of data, operate in real-time applications and help with automation of capabilities is commonly known as traditional AI.

Here are some examples of traditional AI:

| Type                    | Example areas                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Machine Learning** <br>Teaching machines to learn from data.|- Reinforcement <br> - Supervised Learning <br> - Knowledge Learning <br> - Probabilistic Models <br> - Neural networks       |
| **Natural Language Processing**<br>Understand and generate human language. | - Information extraction <br> - Sentiment analysis <br> - Speech recognition <br> - Machine translation <br> - Large Language Models (including ChatGPT) |
| **Robotics**<br>Controlling objects in the physical world.| - Perception <br> - Actuation <br> - Locomotion <br> - Navigation <br> - Mapping localization <br> - Manipulation and grasping |
| **Reasoning**<br>Making informed decisions.| - Knowledge engineering <br> - Planning and scheduling <br> - Learning and adaptation <br> - Explanation and justification <br> - Real world planning |
| **Object Recognition**<br>Recognizing objects in images or video. | - Image processing <br> - Feature extraction <br> - Object detection <br> - Classification <br> - 3D reconstruction <br> - Motion, shading, contour analysis <br> - Scene understanding |
| **Problem solving**<br>Process of finding a solution.| - Search and exploration <br> - Heuristics <br> - Optimization techniques <br> - Uncertainty handling <br> - Constraint analysis <br> - Evolutionary algorithms <br> - Fuzzy logic |

#### Generative AI

With Generative AI (GAI) we typically mean AI that understands and creates content, such as GPT. It works on relatively small chunks of data - text, images, sounds, videos - and has a "liguistic" understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of GAI and the term is often used as a synonym, but LLMs are ones that work on text.

Here are some examples of generative AI:

- **OpenAI**: Ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.
