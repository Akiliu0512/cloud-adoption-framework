# AI adoption on Azure

This collection of guidance shows you how to adopt AI on Azure. It covers generative AI and nongenerative AI adoption. It helps you pick the right AI technology for your use case based on factors like skills, data, and cost. You learn how to assess your AI maturity, access AI resources, plan for responsible AI, and determine whether centralizing AI models is suitable for your organization. Additionally, it guides you in preparing your AI foundation and consistently enforcing security, governance, and management across your cloud environment to protect sensitive data.
