# AI adoption on Azure

The AI adoption scenario in the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) provides a structured approach for adopting AI in Azure. It covers generative AI and nongenerative AI adoption guidance. The recommendations are relevant for organizations of any size and industry. This guidance serves as your roadmap for AI adoption. Use it as a central hub to find the resources and guidance you need.

AI adoption is the process of integrating AI workloads into your organization. Effective AI adoption uses and builds trustworthy AI.

It's a continuous process that contains AI Strategy, AI Plan, AI Ready, Govern AI, Manage AI, and Secure AI. Undergirding the entire process is Responsible AI." lightbox="./images/ai-adoption-process.svg" border="false":::

## Why adopt AI?

AI adoption is foundational to optimizing operations at an individual and organizational level. AI enhances individual efficiency by automating busy work and providing insights. It enhances business efficiency by automating business processes from intelligent chatbots to business forecasts. These uses allow businesses and personnel to focus on the work that matters most. The barrier to adopting AI is lower than it's ever been. Microsoft provides a range of AI services that cater to different skill sets, budgets, and data needs. You decide if you want to buy or build AI workloads based on your business needs.

## How to adopt AI

Adopting AI is a sequential process. It requires ongoing monitoring, governance, and adjustments to adapt to evolving technologies, opportunities, and requirements. The CAF AI Adoption guidance divides AI adoption into 6 steps. Complete all six steps if you're new to AI adoption. Revisit AI Strategy, AI Plan, and AI Ready as needed. Govern AI, Manage AI, and Secure AI are continuous processes that you must iterate through regularly to ensure your AI workloads remain secure, cost-effective, and trustworthy.

1. *AI Strategy*: Choose the right AI technology for each use case based on the required skills, data availability, and associated costs. Define your data and Responsible AI strategy.
1. *AI Plan*: Assess your AI maturity, acquire necessary AI skills, access the AI technology you need, and plan for responsible AI. Part of planning is reviewing the needs of the AI security, governance, and management processes.
1. *AI Ready*: Prepare your Azure environment for deployment and establish a strong security and governance foundation for all AI workloads.
1. *Govern AI*: Control your AI workloads and models by establishing guardrails to ensure compliance and responsible AI use.
1. *Manage AI*: Manage your AI deployments, operations, models, and data over time to ensure they remain aligned with your business goals.
1. *Secure AI*: Assess AI security risks and apply security controls to protect your AI workloads.

## AI adoption checklists

 Use the AI adoption checklists as your AI roadmap. There are checklists for startups and enterprises. We recommend you use the Enterprise checklist. It provides the most comprehensive guidance to prepare your organization for AI at scale. Use the startup checklist for the quickest path to AI adoption. Consult the other guidance as you grow.
