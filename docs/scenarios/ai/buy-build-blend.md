# Buy, build, or blend AI

When building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, designers and architects need to weigh up key technical requirements and considerations as part of the decision to build a Microsoft Copilot solution in pro-code or use alternative capabilities such as low-code, or off-the-shelf solutions instead.

Notably, there's a range of possible ways to deliver a successful traditional or generative AI solution. It's important to ground your choices, as they might come with strategic implications. Carefully consider alignment with company goals and outcomes.

When building AI solutions, there are key considerations that underpin success beyond a proof-of-concept phase. These considerations aren't just technical in nature, and will include:

- Cost
- Scalability
- Long term effort of maintenance and upgrades of the solution.
- Available skill level within the team & availability of development resources.
- The regulatory environment & responsible AI
- The degree of customization of the solution
- Time to market requirements
- The complexity and sensitivity of the data used as part of the solution
- Industry-specific considerations

The choices made against these factors can be strategic, and can help shape a company's competitive advantage as part of a long term roadmap.

## Buying

In many cases, there are factors that might legitimately point towards an approach that involves buying elements of the platform to help deliver AI experiences.

Key advantages to buying the solution include:

- Rapid deployment and a fast path to market
- Proven reliability and performance
- Cost predictability
- Faster access to latest innovations, continuously released into the platform
- Comprehensive support and maintenance.
- Enhanced security and compliance features
- Pre-existing integration into the Microsoft and third-party ecosystem (that is, connectors, plugins)
- User friendly management
- Ability to focus on the experience rather than deep technology configuration and development.

Additional factors to influence the decision would be around the need to control data security, compliance, and scalability, all of which are features typically built-in to the "buy" option.

## Building

Considerations around total cost of ownership, available expertise, and long-term maintenance efforts are key considerations once the solution is up and running.

Building your own solution offers the highest degree in of control and flexibility when crafting solutions, but can also have a higher level of effort at the start, with expertise in all areas of the solution required to ramp it up. While this is a legitimate approach to crafting solutions, it can also in some scenarios increase the length of time it takes to get to market, and subsequently, as part of its lifecycle increase the time to deploy updates.

Looking at the full lifecycle of the solution, it's important to also incorporate the ability to test and monitor solutions as they go into production. For solutions that pick specific models to be able to deliver curated experiences, it's important to have a team that can continuously maintain the solution and help evolve it as models are deprecated or more up to date models become available.

While there's a high degree of flexibility and customization afforded to solution owners in this scenario, it's also a consideration that it has to be fully maintained, and monitored as part of its lifecycle.

## Blend

For many organizations, a hybrid approach combining pro-code and low-code (buy) elements might be ideal. This approach enables using Microsoft's robust, pre-built components while adding custom features where necessary.  

Microsoft's Copilot Studio, for example, offers a platform where businesses can customize and extend functionalities using low-code tools, striking a balance between customization and ease of deployment. This would allow, for instance,  to have full control on the configuration of a given model and content safety features, while not having to fully build out the end user interface, or rebuild existing connectors and channels into various related systems. This can enhance the overall agility of complex solutions where the blended scenario can offer a viable approach.
