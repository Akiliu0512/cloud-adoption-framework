# Find guidance to build AI workloads on Azure

The Azure Architecture Center has reference architectures and guides to build generative AI and nongenerative AI workloads. The following tables provides links to implementation guidance for building generative AI applications.

For Azure landing zone users, start with the [Baseline Azure OpenAI architecture in Azure landing zone](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone).

## Generative AI

## Understand AI workloads

To understand the level of effort to build AI workloads, see the following articles. They provide organizational guidelines for building AI workloads on Azure:

- [AI resource selection](./resource-selection.md)
- [AI networking](./compute.md)
- [AI governance](./compute.md)
- [AI management](./compute.md)
- [AI security](./compute.md)
