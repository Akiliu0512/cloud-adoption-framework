# Implementation options for AI workloads on Azure platforms

The Azure Architecture Center has reference architectures and guides to build generative AI and nongenerative AI workloads. following table provides links to implementation guidance for building generative AI applications.

## Design guidelines

The following articles provide organizational guidelines for adopting Azure AI platforms:

- [AI resource selection](./resource-selection.md)
- [AI networking](./compute.md)
- [AI governance](./compute.md)
- [AI management](./compute.md)
- [AI security](./compute.md)
