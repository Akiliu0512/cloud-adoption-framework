# Implementation options for AI workloads on Azure platforms

The following table provides links to implementation guidance for building generative AI applications.

## Generative AI implementation options

- Recommended for Azure landing zones: [Azure OpenAI chat baseline architecture in an Azure landing zone](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/azure-openai-baseline-landing-zone)
- [Baseline OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/baseline-openai-e2e-chat)
- [Basic OpenAI end-to-end chat reference architecture](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/architecture/basic-openai-e2e-chat)

Additional links:

- [Access Azure OpenAI and other language models through a gateway](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/azure-openai-gateway-guide)
- [Azure OpenAI Landing Zone Solution Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-landing-zone/tree/main)

## Non-generative AI implementation options

Microsoft provides detailed implementation guidance and deployable assets for creating enhanced-security nongenerative AI applications. Use this guidance as a baseline, and adapt the baseline to your needs. Review the [machine learning and AI architectures](/azure/architecture/ai-ml/) to see guidance that's aligned to different use cases.
