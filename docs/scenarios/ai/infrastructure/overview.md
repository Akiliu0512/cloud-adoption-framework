# Adopt AI on Azure infrastructure (IaaS) - Recommendations to build AI applications with Azure infrastructure services (IaaS)

This guidance shows you how to design an AI environment to deploy high-performance computing infrastructure to train and run models using infrastructure-as-a-service solutions.

Why use IaaS to deploy AI?
Choosing IaaS over PaaS for AI solutions is ideal in specific scenarios. Use IaaS when you need maximum control over the environment and configurations, when your AI workload has unique requirements not supported by PaaS, or when you need a hybrid cloud setup and integration with legacy systems. IaaS is also preferred for granular cost control, especially with highly variable workloads.
