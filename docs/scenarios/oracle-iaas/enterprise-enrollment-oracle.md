# Enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator

This article describes enterprise enrollment for Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator. Azure landing zones for Oracle don't have specific  recommendations that impact [enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant decisions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-ad-tenant).

However, it's  important to understand decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to determine enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant outcomes.

You can review the [identity and access management considerations](manage-identity-access-azure-landing-zone.md) to understand how the Active Directory tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You can also evaluate the [resource organization considerations](manage-resources-oracle-landing-zone.md) to understand how to organize enrollment into management groups, subscriptions, or resource groups.
