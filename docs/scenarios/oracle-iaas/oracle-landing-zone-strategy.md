# Strategic impact of Oracle on Azure

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Strategy methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. If you haven't already, use the [strategy and plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/plan/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy-and-plan-template.docx) to record your cloud adoption strategy. This article will help expose a number of technical considerations regarding the Oracle on Azure adoption that may have an impact on your strategy.


## Oracle on Azure adoption motivations

Oracle is a common application suite, and organizations have several motivations to migrate Oracle to the cloud. When an organization considers a cloud strategy for Oracle, the following motivations tend to shape cloud adoption plans:

- **Migration motivations**: If other assets depend on Oracle to migrate successfully, then customers tend to focus on reducing costs, complexities, or operational overhead.

- **Cost optimization motivations**: At scale, cloud optimizes cost with scale when required – pay as you go & right sizing of Oracle on cloud can bring licensing and infrastructure cost down.

- **Innovation motivations**: The cloud unlocks new opportunities like AI & data modernization for the Oracle workload to be transformed and modernized, although this opportunity may not be in scope for the initial migration.

- **Infrastructure scale flexibility requirements**: The cloud offers the ability to seamlessly scale up and down with infrastructure as part of business transformation with any service, including Oracle workloads.

To successfully migrate an Oracle workload to the cloud, you need a cloud strategy team (including business and IT leaders) to review and prioritize the motivations listed in [Cloud motivations](../../strategy/motivations.md). This input helps the cloud adoption team to make informed decisions throughout the implementation process.

Motivations to migrate an Oracle implementation to the cloud are often based on an organization's strategic objectives, and not necessarily limited to the specific workload. Further to the above, the following scenarios can also trigger a move to cloud:

1. Cycles to refresh Oracle on-premises infrastructure require significant capital expenditures. If your Oracle infrastructure is due for a refresh, the benefits of cloud adoption can unlock timely strategies to reduce costs.
2. Oracle licenses are a one-time purchase negotiated for a specific number of years. If you want to migrate your Oracle workloads to Azure, review the following official document to understand the license implications on Azure: [Licensing Oracle Software in the Cloud Computing Environment](https://www.oracle.com/assets/cloud-licensing-070579.pdf).
3. If your Oracle maintenance contracts are coming up for renewal, which typically happens on a yearly basis, your contract renewal too can be a trigger to consider moving to cloud. Also, an upcoming refresh to a newer Oracle software version triggered by Oracle upgrade cycles, application requirements, or a business driver should also be reason to consider cloud options.  

## Oracle on Azure adoption outcomes

Typical outcomes for migrating an Oracle workload to Azure include, but are not necessarily limited to:

-	**Reduced cost:** Migrating to Azure can decrease the total cost of ownership for Oracle workloads. You achieve this through efficient sizing, automated scaling, and reduced operational costs.
-	**Faster innovation:** The cloud environment fosters innovation for Oracle workloads by integrating advanced technologies such as AI and data modernization. It accelerates the deployment of new business capabilities.
-	**Increased agility:** Cloud migration enhances the agility of Oracle workloads, facilitating rapid scalability. You can easily extend into new markets and geographies with minimal investment.
-	**Improve operational efficiency:** Oracle on Azure enhances operational efficiency by automating routine tasks and streamlining operations. It lowers operational overhead and increasing productivity.



## Build a business justification for cloud migration

Building a business justification for cloud migration can dispel several common myths for your team's financial plan. However, your finance team might need to develop a detailed financial model to account for the moving pieces associated with Oracle cloud adoption.

Understand that your initial business justification is a directional estimate that can help to drive strategic alignment. Your organization can create transparency between the cloud strategy team and other stakeholders by affirming that this justification can change significantly throughout planning activities. Look for consensus that there's enough value to gather inventory and develop a plan. Once your digital estate is cataloged and assessed, you can refine your justification and present clearer plans for financial returns.
