# Strategic impact of Oracle on Azure

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy by using the [Strategy methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. If you haven't already, use the [strategy and plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/main/plan/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy-and-plan-template.docx) to record your cloud adoption strategy. This article describes technical considerations for the adoption of Oracle on Azure that might affect your strategy.

## Oracle on Azure adoption motivations

Motivations to migrate an Oracle implementation to the cloud are often based on an organization's strategic objectives and are not necessarily limited to the specific workload. To successfully migrate an Oracle workload to the cloud, you need a cloud strategy team that includes business and IT leaders to review and prioritize the motivations. This input helps the cloud adoption team make informed decisions throughout the implementation process. The following motivations tend to shape cloud adoption plans when an organization considers a cloud strategy for Oracle:

- **Cost-optimization motivations**: Refreshing an on-premises infrastructure for Oracle requires significant capital. Migration to the cloud can minimize these costs by reducing investment in physical assets.
- **Innovation motivations**: The cloud unlocks new opportunities like AI and data modernization for the Oracle workload to be transformed and modernized. However, this opportunity might not be in scope for the initial migration.
- **Scalability motivations**: The cloud offers the ability to seamlessly scale up and down with infrastructure, including Oracle workloads, as part of business transformation.
- **Contractual and software motivations**: Annual renewals of Oracle maintenance contracts and updates to newer Oracle software versions can trigger a migration to the cloud to capitalize on technological upgrades.  

## Oracle on Azure adoption outcomes

Typical outcomes for migrating an Oracle workload to Azure include, but aren't necessarily limited to:

- **Reduced cost:** Migrating to Azure can decrease the total cost of ownership for Oracle workloads. You decrease the total cost of ownership through efficient sizing, automated scaling, and reduced operational costs.
- **Faster innovation:** The cloud environment fosters innovation for Oracle workloads by integrating advanced technologies such as AI and data modernization and accelerates the deployment of new business capabilities. For example, you can use Azure AI and machine learning services to analyze Oracle data and gain new insights that are difficult to achieve on premises.
- **Increased agility:** Cloud migration enhances the agility of Oracle workloads, facilitating rapid scalability. You can extend into new markets and geographies more easily than on-premises. For example, if you were to expand services to a new region, you can easily deploy Oracle databases and application services in that region using Azure. Consider also data center expansion, network connectivity, and other infrastructure requirements that would be a more labor intensive and costly operation on premises.
- **Improve operational efficiency:** Oracle on Azure enhances operational efficiency by automating routine tasks and streamlining operations. It lowers operational overhead and increasing productivity. You can, for example,  use GitHub to automate Oracle database deployments and updates, as well as use built-in services to turn off or down-size development and test environments when not in use.

## Build a business justification for cloud migration

Building a business justification for cloud migration can dispel several common myths for your team's financial plan. However, your finance team might need to develop a detailed financial model to account for the moving pieces associated with Oracle cloud adoption.

Understand that your initial business justification is a directional estimate that can help to drive strategic alignment. Your organization can create transparency between the cloud strategy team and other stakeholders by affirming that this justification can change significantly throughout planning activities. Look for consensus that there's enough value to gather inventory and develop a plan. Once your digital estate is cataloged and assessed, you can refine your justification and present clearer plans for financial returns.
