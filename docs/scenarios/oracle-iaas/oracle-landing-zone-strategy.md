# Strategic impact of Oracle on Azure

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Strategy methodology](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy) of the Cloud Adoption Framework. If you haven't already, use the [strategy and plan template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/plan/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy-and-plan-template.docx) to record your cloud adoption strategy. This article will help expose a number of technical considerations regarding the Oracle on Azure adoption that may have an impact on your strategy.

## Oracle on Azure adoption motivations

Motivations to migrate an Oracle implementation to the cloud are often based on an organization's strategic objectives, and not necessarily limited to the specific workload. To successfully migrate an Oracle workload to the cloud, you need a cloud strategy team (including business and IT leaders) to review and prioritize the motivations listed in Cloud motivations. This input helps the cloud adoption team to make informed decisions throughout the implementation process. When an organization considers a cloud strategy for Oracle, the following motivations tend to shape cloud adoption plans:

Cost optimization motivations:  Refreshing Oracle's on-premises infrastructure requires significant capital. Migrating to the cloud can minimize these costs by reducing investment in physical assets.

Innovation motivations: The cloud unlocks new opportunities like AI & data modernization for the Oracle workload to be transformed and modernized, although this opportunity may not be in scope for the initial migration.

Scalability motivations: The cloud offers the ability to seamlessly scale up and down with infrastructure as part of business transformation with any service, including Oracle workloads.

**Contractual and Software motivations**: Annual renewals of Oracle maintenance contracts and updates to newer Oracle software versions can trigger a migration to the cloud to capitalize on technological upgrades.  

## Oracle on Azure adoption outcomes

Typical outcomes for migrating an Oracle workload to Azure include, but are not necessarily limited to:

- **Reduced cost:** Migrating to Azure can decrease the total cost of ownership for Oracle workloads. You achieve this through efficient sizing, automated scaling, and reduced operational costs.
- **Faster innovation:** The cloud environment fosters innovation for Oracle workloads by integrating advanced technologies such as AI and data modernization. It accelerates the deployment of new business capabilities.
- **Increased agility:** Cloud migration enhances the agility of Oracle workloads, facilitating rapid scalability. You can easily extend into new markets and geographies with minimal investment.
- **Improve operational efficiency:** Oracle on Azure enhances operational efficiency by automating routine tasks and streamlining operations. It lowers operational overhead and increasing productivity.

## Build a business justification for cloud migration

Building a business justification for cloud migration can dispel several common myths for your team's financial plan. However, your finance team might need to develop a detailed financial model to account for the moving pieces associated with Oracle cloud adoption.

Understand that your initial business justification is a directional estimate that can help to drive strategic alignment. Your organization can create transparency between the cloud strategy team and other stakeholders by affirming that this justification can change significantly throughout planning activities. Look for consensus that there's enough value to gather inventory and develop a plan. Once your digital estate is cataloged and assessed, you can refine your justification and present clearer plans for financial returns.
