# Introduction to Oracle on Azure Virtual Machines landing zone accelerator migration scenario

The articles in this series describe how Oracle workloads affect your overall strategy, cloud adoption plan, and environmental readiness efforts, with detailed guidance on specific efforts. Once an environment is established, the series explains the processes for migrating an Oracle platform and how to use cloud technologies to innovate on that workload. To support your cloud adoption needs, the series also outlines considerations and best practices for managing governance and operations throughout an Oracle migration, and subsequent operation of your Oracle environment on Azure.

## Oracle workload migration process

Migrating Oracle workloads to the cloud incorporates and addresses most of the methodologies and phases within the Cloud Adoption Framework. Distinct constraints within each phase require actions specific to Oracle, and this series of articles maps standard processes to Oracle-specific tasks
