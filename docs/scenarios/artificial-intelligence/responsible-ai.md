# Responsible AI adoption

- Intro to Responsible AI, and why it matters when adopting AI into your organization.

## The Responsible AI Principles

Microsoft believes in [empowering responsible AI practices](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai).

There are **six key principles** for responsible AI:

- **Fairness**: AI systems should treat all people fairly.
- **Reliability and safety**: AI systems should perform reliably and safely.
- **Privacy and security**: AI systems should respect privacy and maintain security.
- **Inclusiveness**: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people.
- **Transparency**: AI systems should be transparent and understandable.
- **Accountability**: AI systems should be accountable and answerable.

 These principles are essential to creating responsible and trustworthy AI as it moves into mainstream products and services. They're guided by **two perspectives**:

- **Ethical**: AI should be designed and used in ways that are consistent with ethical principles that prioritize people and the planet.
- **Explainable**: AI should be designed and used in ways that are transparent and can be understood by people.

## The importance of responsible AI

- **Unintended consequences**: Careful planning and oversight are important to reduce the risk of unforeseen impacts with ethical implications.
- **Evolving threats**: Novel threats appear regularly as AI technology evolves, and it's important to stay ahead of these threats. Staying aligned to the principles of responsible AI can help mitigate some of these threats.
- **Bias**: Mitigating bias in AI can be challenging, but it's important to ensure that AI systems are fair and unbiased. The responsible AI principles can help guide you in this area.
- **Sensitive technologies**: Certain technologies like facial recognition can be considered a sensitive technology due to the risk to fundamental freedoms and human rights. It's important to consider the implications of using such technologies and to ensure that they're used responsibly.
