# Leadership and organizational readiness for generative AI

Be proactive in removing any barriers to adoption and ensure that your leadership is aligned with your vision and strategy for generative AI.

Consider asking yourself:

- How well aligned is your **leadership**, **organization**, and **employees** with your vision and strategy for generative AI?

## Leadership buy-in

You identified the potential benefits of generative AI and have a clear vision and strategy. Now you need to ensure that your leadership is aligned to that vision and strategy.

### Risks

If you don't have leadership buy-in for your AI adoption plans, it can result in several significant risks. Here are a few examples:

- **Lack of strategic alignment**: It can be challenging to align your AI initiatives with your organization's strategic goals. A consequence might be that you're not delivering on measurable or long-term business goals.
- **Lack of resources**: AI projects can require significant investments in resources, technology, talent, and time. Securing the required resources might not be possible without leadership buy-in. A consequence might be that you're not able to execute on your AI initiatives with the required quality or speed.
- **Lack of adaptability**: If leadership buy-in doesn't exist, employees might resist AI adoption due to lack of unclear benefits. This can result in a lack of adaptability to change, which can hinder the success of your AI initiatives.
- **Lack of competitive advantage**: Without leadership support, the organization might lag behind competitors who are successfully adopting AI to improve their efficiency, innovation, and customer insights.

### Recommendations

- **Consider AI in decision-making**
  - Regularly communicate the strategic importance of AI to the entire organization.
  - Integrate AI into strategic planning and decision-making processes.
  - See [how AI transforms decision-making](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/09/how-artificial-intelligence-will-transform-decision-making/).
- **Bring visibility to successful AI projects**
  - Showcase successful AI projects to underscore its value to leadership.
  - See [customer stories for Artificial Intelligence](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/search?sq=&ff=story_product_categories%26%3EArtificial%20Intelligence&p=0&so=cam_rank%20desc).
- **Drive an innovate culture**
  - Continuous learning helps drive AI innovation. See [Continuous learning](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/considerations/learn#continuous-learning).

## Organizational alignment

A leader-stage company is characterized by the existence of a well-defined, comprehensive, and future-proof strategy. This strategy isn't only clear and specific, but also fully integrated into the broader business strategy. It specifies how AI technologies are intended to support and enhance business objectives, ensuring that all AI initiatives are aligned with, and contribute to, the overarching goals of the organization.

Consider the importance of organizational alignment:

- **Communicate the AI strategy**
  - Communicate the strategy and vision as an integral part of the overall business strategy.
  - Articulate how AI can support and enhance specific business objectives.
  - See [Building a foundation for AI success: Business strategy](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/01/building-a-foundation-for-ai-success-business-strategy/)
- **Review and realign**
  - Regularly review and update the strategy as necessary to reflect changes in business objectives or advancements in AI technology.
- **Measure effectiveness**
  - Drive toward implementing tools and processes to measure the effectiveness of AI initiatives in achieving the business objectives, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of the strategy.
  - If you can measure the effectiveness of your AI initiatives, you can better understand the value they bring to your organization, and get wider buy-in from stakeholders.

## Employee readiness

Employees who are ready to work with AI technologies can integrate them into their workflows more seamlessly, minimizing disruption and ensuring that AI solutions are used to their full potential.

As a few examples, consider the following risks:

- Lack of readiness can lead to resistance, operational inefficiencies, and failure to benefit from the full potential of your AI investments. Without proper readiness, the organization might not realize the full benefits of their AI investments, resulting in suboptimal performance and wasted resources.
- Preparing employees for AI adoption helps cultivate a culture of continuous learning and innovation, which is essential for staying competitive in today's rapidly evolving business- and technological landscapes.

**Recommendations:**

- **Invest in skilling your workforce**: Invest in upskilling and reskilling programs to prepare employees for AI adoption. See [Skills readiness plan for AI](./skills-readiness-ai.md).
- **Establish change management**: Establish change management and communication plans to ensure that employees are informed and engaged throughout the AI adoption process. See [Change management and communication](#change-management-and-communication).

## Change management and communication

Change management and communication help ensure that employees are informed, engaged, and prepared for the changes that AI adoption bring. Neglecting AI change management might lead to operational inefficiencies and employee resistance, resulting in wasted investments and missed opportunities.

**Recommendations:**

When you develop your change management and communication plans, consider ensuring the following items are included:

- **Leadership and vision communication**: Ensure there's a strong leadership and a clear vision, aligned with [organizational AI goals](./business-justification-goals.md#define-goals). Secure executive sponsorship as necessary, and communicate the vision and strategy to the entire organization.
- **Engagement and readiness**: Ensure there's a continuous focus on employee engagement and readiness, including an [AI skills readiness plan](./skills-readiness-ai.md).
- **Process integration**: Regularly assess your existing workflows and processes, and redesign them to integrate AI technologies where appropriate. Ensure that employees are trained on the new processes and workflows.
- **Communicate AI benefits**: Track and report on key performance indicators (KPIs) and success stories to illustrate the positive impact of AI in the organization. Continuously communicate the benefits of AI adoption to employees, fostering a culture of innovation and continuous learning, and ensuring that employees are motivated to adopt AI technologies.

## Encourage an adaptable strategy

With the fact-paced evolution of AI technologies, it's important to establish an adaptable AI strategy that can evolve with the technology and the business needs. This strategy should be aligned with the overall business strategy and should be able to adapt to changes in the business environment.

**Recommendations:**

- **Review regularly**: Regularly review and update the AI strategy to reflect changes in business objectives or advancements in AI technology. Don't treat the AI strategy as a one-time project, but as an ongoing process.
- **Capture data**: Analyze data from ongoing and past AI implementations to ensure continuous alignment to business objectives. Refine the business strategy based on the insights gained from the past AI implementations.
- **Prepare for pivots**: Be prepared to pivot the AI strategy based on the insights gained from the data analysis. Be open to changing the strategy if the data suggests that the current strategy isn't aligned with the business objectives.
- **Stay informed**: Stay informed about the latest AI technologies and trends. Be prepared to incorporate new technologies into the AI strategy if they align with the business objectives.
- **Feedback mechanism**: Develop a robust feedback mechanism to learn from the successes and failures in AI implementations with full transparency. Use those learnings to continuously invest in skilling, refining the AI strategy, and improving the business outcomes.
