# Governing AI in Azure

Introductory paragraph - TO DO

## Checklist

The following table provides an overview of recommended components to embrace in your AI governance processes.

|AI governance plan component|Description|
|---|---|
| Understand the importance of governing AI | |
| Establish an AI governance team (AI COE)|  |
| Assess and document AI risks | Use the Cloud Adoption Framework Govern methodology to establish a governance function within your organization. Apply an AI lens to cater for the potential risks and impact of adopting AI. |
| Enforce AI governance policies | |
| Monitor AI governance | |

## Understand the importance of governing AI

### Consider asking yourself

- To what extent you have a **plan to manage potential risks** associated with AI (for example, data security, privacy, ethical considerations)?
- How **comprehensive is your plan** to address potential risks and challenges related to AI adoption?
- How **effective is your data governance framework** in managing data access, usage, privacy, and security?
- How often **do you audit your data management practices** for quality and compliance?

## AI governance team

-> Point to Govern. INject the importance of adding AI to that governance team; potentially as part of your AI CoE.

## Assess risks

Risks are associated with all areas of business. With generative AI, there are new risks to consider. While there are many risk areas, let's focus on a few examples:

- Regulatory risks
- Reputational risks
- Competency risks
- Financial risks

### Example risks

|Risk area|Example risks|
|---------|-------------|
|Regulatory risk|Noncompliance with legal and regulatory considerations for generative AI in your industry or region.|
|Reputational risk|Negative public perception of your organization's use of generative AI.|
|Competency risk|Lack of skills and knowledge to effectively manage generative AI in your organization.|
|Financial risk|Unforeseen costs associated with generative AI adoption.|

### Enforce AI governance policies

Mitigate risks by enforcing AI governance polities.

- See Govern for examples. Add AI-specific examples here.
- Establish policies.

## Monitor AI governance

- Monitor your AI governance.
- Add examples of how.
