# Governing generative AI in Azure

## AI governance team

-> Point to Govern. INject the importance of adding AI to that governance team; potentially as part of your AI CoE.

## Assess risks

Risks are associated with all areas of business. With generative AI, there are new risks to consider. While there are many risk areas, let's focus on a few examples:

- Regulatory risks
- Reputational risks
- Competency risks
- Financial risks

### Example risks

|Risk area|Example risks|
|---------|-------------|
|Regulatory risk|Noncompliance with legal and regulatory considerations for generative AI in your industry or region.|
|Reputational risk|Negative public perception of your organization's use of generative AI.|
|Competency risk|Lack of skills and knowledge to effectively manage generative AI in your organization.|
|Financial risk|Unforeseen costs associated with generative AI adoption.|

### Enforce AI governance policies

Mitigate risks by enforcing AI governance polities.

- See Govern for examples. Add AI-specific examples here.
- Establish policies.

## Monitor AI governance

- Monitor AI your AI governance.
- Add examples of how.

## Compliance

### Policy enforcement

### Understanding regulatory requirements

### Compliance monitoring and reporting

## Data management

### Data quality

### Data lifecycle

### Data privacy

### Data access control

### Data security

### Data segregation to different environments

## Other risk considerations

> TBD

- To what extent you have a **plan to manage potential risks** associated with AI (for example, data security, privacy, ethical considerations)?
- How **comprehensive is your plan** to address potential risks and challenges related to AI adoption?
- How **effective is your data governance framework** in managing data access, usage, privacy, and security?
- How often **do you audit your data management practices** for quality and compliance?
