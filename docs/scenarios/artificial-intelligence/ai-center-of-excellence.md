# AI Center of Excellence

An AI Center of Excellence is a strategic initiative designed to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence within organizations, both startups and enterprises. An AI CoE initiative aligns closely with the foundational principles outlines in [Building a Foundation for AI Success: A Leader's Guide](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-building-a-foundation-for-ai-success.html).

An AI Center of Excellence is a cross-functional team that provides leadership, standards, and best practices for organizations AI initiatives. It plays a crucial role in guiding and overseeing AI projects, bridging the gap between executive decision-making and AI implementation.

## What differs a Cloud vs AI Center of Excellence?

The [Cloud Center of Excellence](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) (CoE), is building the foundation around cloud adoption and optimization by supporting cloud strategy, governance, and implementation. On the other hand, an AI Center of Excellence is driving AI initiatives within an organization and providing best practices and standards for AI projects, specifically. Both types of Center of Excellence play a critical role but focusing on different domains.

## Key functions of an AI Center of Excellence

An AI Center of Excellence integrates and operationalizes the [Five Pillars of AI Success](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-building-a-foundation-for-ai-success.html):

1. **Business strategy**: Clearly defined and prioritized business objectives, use cases, and measurement of AI value.
1. **Technology strategy**: An AI-ready application and data platform architecture, aligned parameters for build vs. buy decisions, and plans for where to host data and applications to optimize outcomes.
1. **AI strategy and experience**: A systematic, customer-centric approach to AI that includes applying the right model to the right use case and experience in building, testing, and realizing AI value across multiple business units, use cases, and dimensions.
1. **Organization and culture**: A clear operating model, leadership support, change-management process, access to continuous learning and development, and strong relationships with diverse subject-matter experts.
1. **AI Governance**: Implementation of processes, controls, and accountability structures to govern data privacy, security, and responsible use of AI.

The AI CoE aims to ensure that AI initiatives are integrated with the organization's strategic objectives, leans on a robust technological foundation, and are implemented with a focus on user experience and ethical considerations.

This initiative is crucial for scaling AI solutions effectively, fostering a culture of innovation and maintaining agility in AI governance. The AI CoE serves as a nexus for expertise, guiding the organization through the complexities of AI adoption while promoting the responsible and impactful use of AI technologies. By building on these pillars, the CoE amplify the strategic value derives from AI, and reinforces the organization's commitment to leading in the era of AI.

## AI CoE structure

The AI CoE executes a cohesive strategy that combines AI development with overarching business goals, enhancing both the pro developer and citizen developer journeys. The model outlines processes for enabling developers and users through resources, training, and support mechanisms, ensuring AI initiatives drive meaningful business outcomes and superior user experiences. It also emphasizes modern service management in supporting these endeavors, ensuring the AI CoE facilitates a structured yet agile approach to AI integration across the enterprise.

It underscores a holistic approach, integrating community support, integrated administration and reporting, self-help and automated communications, and a robust oversight mechanism to foster an environment conducive to AI innovation and responsible use. The model advocates for identifying high-value AI opportunities with an intake process, ensuring AI practices are secure, and sharing knowledge globally.

The elements or approach for an AI CoE is not particularly radical. Besides defining a strategic vision for AI adoption and aligning it with business goals, the identification of several use cases is key for ensuring faster time-to-value. Below some recommendations on the elements and approach.

## Why implement an AI Center of Excellence?

- **Enable strategic AI deployments across the enterprise:**: Defines an outcome-driven process that ensures employees have access, know how to use the platform, and can grow in their AI skills to drive productivity while giving your organization the capability to continually manage the growth of AI across the enterprise.
- **Ensure employee adoption**: Driving adoption is critical to the success of AI in any organization. Implementing an AI CoE will allow employees to have a one stop shop for all things AI, from training resources, knowledge boosts, and community collaboration.
- **Optimize AI operations**: An AI CoE will establish the processes, controls, and accountability structures needed to govern access, usage, data privacy, security, and operational efficiency. The CoE will build a bridge between IT and the business to optimize AI across the organization.

## Responsibilities of the AI CoE team

- Develops and maintains a service model approach to enable COE operations.
- Implements the framework so the CoE team can grow with the AI usage across the organization.
- Provides a one stop approach to educating, nurturing, adopting, and maintaining AI across the enterprise.
- Ensures the organization can manage the growth of the platform based on the needs of the organization today and into the future.

## Planning considerations for an initial AI adoption budget

To be successful with adopting AI, you need to plan and estimate the required budget. This includes the costs for acquiring the necessary skills, tools, and the costs for maintaining the AI solutions. If you have a clear financial commitment to AI as a strategic priority, planning for a budget becomes easier.

**Recommendations:**

- **Initial budget**: Establish a dedicated budget for AI adoption, factoring in all associated costs you can map out. Consider this your initial boilerplate template for financial planning. Treat your AI adoption budget as a strategic investment in your organization's strategic growth.
- **Regular reviews**: Regularly review and update your budget to reflect changes in your AI adoption strategy, the skills you need, and the tools you use.
- **Invest in the right people**: Invest in your people by providing them with the necessary training and resources to succeed in your AI initiatives, and invest in hiring the right people with experience that maps to your strategic AI objectives.
