# AI Center of Excellence

An AI Center of Excellence is a strategic initiative designed to harness the transformative power of artificial intelligence within organizations, both **startups and enterprises**. An AI CoE initiative aligns closely with the foundational principles outlines in [Building a Foundation for AI Success: A Leader's Guide](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-building-a-foundation-for-ai-success.html).

An AI Center of Excellence is a cross-functional team that provides leadership, standards, and best practices for organizations AI initiatives. It plays a crucial role in guiding and overseeing AI projects, bridging the gap between executive decision-making and AI implementation.

Typically, the AI Center of Excellence can be either an extension of your existing Cloud Center of Excellence, or a new addition to your organization's structure.

In contrast to the AI aspect, a [Cloud Center of Excellence](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-center-of-excellence) (CoE), is building the foundation around cloud adoption and optimization by supporting cloud strategy, governance, and implementation. On the other hand, an AI Center of Excellence is driving AI initiatives within an organization and providing best practices and standards for AI projects, specifically. Both types of Center of Excellence play a critical role but focusing on different domains.

## Key reasons to have an AI Center of Excellence

An AI Center of Excellence integrates and operationalizes the [Five Pillars of AI Success](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-building-a-foundation-for-ai-success.html):

1. **Business strategy**: Develops clearly defined and prioritized business objectives, identifies key use cases, and establishes metrics to measure the value derived from AI initiatives.
1. **Technology strategy**: Designs an AI-ready application and data platform architecture, determines the parameters for making build vs. buy decisions, and formulates plans for optimal data and application hosting.
1. **AI strategy and experience**: Implements a customer-centric AI approach, ensuring the correct models are applied to appropriate use cases and applying experience in building, testing, and realizing AI value across various business units and scenarios.
1. **Organization and culture**: Establishes a clear operating model, secures leadership support, manages change processes effectively, provides access to continuous learning and development opportunities, and fosters strong relationships with diverse subject-matter experts.
1. **AI governance**: Sets up processes, controls, and accountability structures to oversee data privacy, security, and the ethical use of AI technologies.

The AI CoE aims to ensure that AI initiatives are integrated with the organization's strategic objectives, leans on a robust technological foundation, and are implemented with a focus on user experience and ethical considerations.

This initiative is crucial for scaling AI solutions effectively, fostering a culture of innovation and maintaining agility in AI governance. The AI CoE serves as a nexus for expertise, guiding the organization through the complexities of AI adoption while promoting the responsible and impactful use of AI technologies. By building on these pillars, the CoE amplify the strategic value derives from AI, and reinforces the organization's commitment to leading in the era of AI.

## AI CoE structure

The AI CoE executes a cohesive strategy that combines AI development with overarching business goals, enhancing both the pro developer and citizen developer journeys. The model outlines processes for enabling developers and users through resources, training, and support mechanisms, ensuring AI initiatives drive meaningful business outcomes and superior user experiences. It also emphasizes modern service management in supporting these endeavors, ensuring the AI CoE facilitates a structured yet agile approach to AI integration across the enterprise.

It underscores a holistic approach, integrating community support, integrated administration and reporting, self-help and automated communications, and a robust oversight mechanism to foster an environment conducive to AI innovation and responsible use. The model advocates for identifying high-value AI opportunities with an intake process, ensuring AI practices are secure, and sharing knowledge globally.

Besides defining a strategic vision for AI adoption and aligning it with business goals, the identification of several use cases is key for ensuring faster time-to-value. Below some recommendations on the elements and approach.

## Why implement an AI Center of Excellence?

- **Enable strategic AI deployments across the enterprise:**: Defines an outcome-driven process that ensures employees have access, know how to use the platform, and can grow in their AI skills to drive productivity while giving your organization the capability to continually manage the growth of AI across the enterprise.
- **Ensure employee adoption**: Driving adoption is critical to the success of AI in any organization. Implementing an AI CoE allows employees to have a one stop shop for all things AI, from training resources, knowledge boosts, and community collaboration.
- **Optimize AI operations**: An AI CoE establishes the processes, controls, and accountability structures needed to govern access, usage, data privacy, security, and operational efficiency. The CoE builds a bridge between IT and the business to optimize AI across the organization.

## Responsibilities of the AI CoE team

- Develops and maintains a service model approach to enable CoE operations.
- Implements the framework so the CoE team can grow with the AI usage across the organization.
- Provides a one stop approach to educating, nurturing, adopting, and maintaining AI across the enterprise.
- Ensures the organization can manage the growth of the platform based on the needs of the organization today and into the future.
