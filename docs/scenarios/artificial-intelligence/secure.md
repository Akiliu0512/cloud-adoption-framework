Introductory paragraph - TO DO

## Checklist

The following table provides an overview of the secure methodology and how it applies to generative AI.

|Article|Description|
|---|---|---|
|[Secure principles](./secure-principles.md)|Considerations for applying the CAF Secure methodology principles to generative AI investments.|
|[Secure approaches](./secure-approaches.md)|Learn how to approach security efforts for generative AI projects.|
|[Secure preparedness](./secure-preparedness.md)|Learn how to embrace security preparedness for  generative AI projects.|

## Shared responsibility

Much like the traditional [shared responsibility model in the cloud](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility), AI in Azure also follows an [AI shared responsibility model](/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility-ai). This model defines the responsibilities of Microsoft and the customer in securing the AI services and data.
