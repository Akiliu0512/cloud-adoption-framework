# Skills readiness plan for generative AI


## Define a skills readiness plan

The Plan methodology in CAF provides guidance on [creating a skills readiness plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes) for your organization. Base your requirements on the original guidance, and adapt it with the requirements around generative AI.

For your generative AI business scenarios, define the required skills across your leadership, technical teams, and end users.

Consider these important key points to include in your skilling plan:

- **Readiness plan**: Build on the premise of creating a new skills readiness plan and [capture concerns, identify gaps, and partner across teams](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes#partner-across-teams).
- **Identify existing skills**: You should identify the skills that your organization already has. Map these to functions, roles, or teams to build an understanding where you have the strengths and weaknesses in generative AI experience and skills.
- **Identify gaps in skills**: You should identify the skills that you need to acquire. See the recommended learning resources at the end of this article.
- **Measure success**
  - Define ways to keep your organization's skills up to date regularly.
  - Define a way to measure the effectiveness of your skills readiness plan.

### Required skills

Having the right skills in place is crucial for the success of your generative AI initiatives. Here are some key skills to consider for the high-level functions in your organization.

- **Leadership**: For leadership, it's important to understand the **impact** of generative AI, what options exist, and how to make decisions based on the insights provided by generative AI.
- **Tech specialists**: For technical specialists, it's important to understand the **technical aspects** of generative AI, how to implement it, and how to maintain it.
- **End users**: For end users, it's important to understand how to **interact** with generative AI, how to use it, and how to provide feedback.
