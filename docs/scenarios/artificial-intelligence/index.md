# Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption in Azure

 <!-- In the rapidly evolving landscape of modern business, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative force, revolutionizing industries and reshaping how organizations operate.

In this Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) guidance, we'll explore how to adopt both traditional and generative AI in your organization, and how to build a strategy for success. -->

## What is generative AI?

 <!-- Generative AI is a type of AI that can generate content, such as text, images, sounds, and videos. Generative AI is focused on creativity, allowing innovation with new products, new services, serving new industries, and more. It's a subset of AI that focuses on understanding and creating content, as opposed to traditional AI. Traditional AI, sometimes known as "Everyday AI," focuses on detecting and classifying content and productivity enhancement.

For more information, see [Generative AI vs. Traditional AI](./generative-vs-traditional-ai.md). 

## Intended audience

In this guidance we talk to **business decision makers**, **IT decision makers**, and **cloud architects** who are interested in understanding how to adopt generative AI in their organization.

We also talk about the business justifications, building a strategy, and the technical aspects of adopting generative AI in Azure. -->

## Next steps

 <!-- Before diving into the details about building a generative AI strategy for your business, you should establish clear business justifications and goals for your organization.
