# Security for finance HPC

It would be important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to be aware of existing [security recommendations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/security).
We also recommend that you consider Azure security baseline recommendations provided for various services used in HPC environment including
 - [Azure HPC Cache](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/hpc-cache-security-baseline)
 - [Azure Cycelcloud](/azure/cyclecloud/concepts/security-best-practices?view=cyclecloud-8)
 - [Azure Batch](/azure/batch/security-controls-policy)

## Next steps
The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario for energy HPC environments.
