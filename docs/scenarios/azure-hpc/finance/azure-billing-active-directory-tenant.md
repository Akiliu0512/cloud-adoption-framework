# Azure billing offers and Active Directory tenants for finance HPC

Azure landing zones for HPC in finance don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Active Directory tenant decisions.

## Previous recommendations 

Keep in mind that it could be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so you know about existing [enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant decisions](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-ad-tenant.md).

You might also want to review the [identity and access management considerations](../../sap/eslz-identity-and-access-management.md) so you understand how the Active Directory tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. And you might want to evaluate the [resource organization considerations](../../sap/eslz-resource-organization.md) so you understand how the enrollment might be organized into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
