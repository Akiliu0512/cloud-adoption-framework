# Azure Landing Zone review for HPC

The [Ready methodology](../../ready/index.md) of the Microsoft Azure Cloud Adoption Framework guides customers through environment readiness to prepare for cloud adoption. The readiness section includes technical accelerators (Azure landing zones), which are the basic building block in any cloud adoption environment. Landing zones automate the configuration of your Azure environment, aligning with best practices guidance in the Cloud Adoption Framework. When preparing for a HPC, there are a number of environment configurations that may be slightly different.

This article outlines key considerations and changes that are necessary to prepare your environments for the following:

## HPC evaluation

What should the customer be looking for when evaluating an Azure Landing Zone for compatibility?

## HPC Azure Landing Zone acceleration

Reference any articles, reference architectures, or best practices that would accelerate deployment of an Azure Landing Zone that passed the evaluation criteria.

## Next steps

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
