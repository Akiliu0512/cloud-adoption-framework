# Introduction to the Azure high-performance computing (HPC) scenario

This article focuses on modernizing your machine learning, visualization, and rendering workloads in Azure at any scale with HPC + AI through the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## Defining HPC

High-performance computing (HPC) in Azure is the complete set of computing, networking, and storage resources integrated with workload orchestration services for applications that provide advanced analytics, graphic-intensive visualizations, and scalable rendering.

Industries such as automotive, energy, health and life sciences, silicon, and manufacturing typically use Azure HPC workloads to run complex simulations such as 3D modeling or mathematical tasks  with their known and familiar tools/processes to perform the intensive and potential thousands of compute hours in a matter of days.

While the computation of their data is being orchestrated, each industry customer can focus more on analyzing and creating value from the results to prioritize and achieve their business goals in a cost effective and timely manner.



## HPC narrative

As customers choose the relevant HPC solution for their specialized computing tasks, there will also need to be considerations for following the [Cloud Adoption Framework](../../overview.md) to prepare decision makers and central IT for successful cloud adoption.

## Next step: Integrate HPC into your cloud adoption journey

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
