# Manage Azure high-performance computing (HPC)

The [Manage methodology](../../manage/index.md) in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure outlines a path for implementing an operations baseline, and maturing that baseline throughout your cloud adoption lifecycle.

Azure landing zones for HPC do not have any specific considerations or recommendations which would impact management related decisions.

However, it could be important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to be aware of existingâ€¯ management recommendations.

## HPC business alignment

For [business alignment](../../manage/considerations/business-alignment.md), review your collection of HPC workloads by mapping them to business processes to determine criticality, understanding the impact of outages for return on investment for cloud management, and commit to developing true partnerships with creating and documenting agreements with your business.

## HPC operations baseline

HPC workloads do not have special requirements for operational compliance but it would be important to review how the [components of operations compliance](../../manage/considerations/operational-compliance.md#components-of-operations-compliance) are implemented by the cloud management team.

## HPC platform operations

For defining HPC platform operations, you'll want to refer to the cloud adoption guidance in [cloud management](../../manage/considerations/platform.md) establish a service catalog by building and defining your platform operations.

Get started by reviewing how your organization's data is hosted in either specific platforms such as platform as a service (PaaS) or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) when building out your service catalog.

## HPC workload operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the individual workloads running on this platform?
