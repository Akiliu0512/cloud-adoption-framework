# Manage HPC

The [Manage methodology](../../manage/index.md) in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure outlines a path for implementing an operations baseline, and maturing that baseline throughout your cloud adoption lifecycle.

Describe how your scenario changes operations management

## HPC business alignment

Does this scenario require the customer to rethink business alignment or how the platform is supported in operations management?

## HPC operations baseline

Does this workload have special requirements for Visibility, Operational Compliance, or BCDR?

## HPC platform operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the landing zone or platform for this scenario?

## HPC workload operations

Are there specific requirements for operations of the individual workloads running on this platform?

## Next steps

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
