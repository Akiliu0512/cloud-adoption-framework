# Govern Azure high-performance computing (HPC)

The [Cloud Adoption Framework provides a methodology](../../govern/index.md) to systematically and incrementally improve governance of your cloud portfolio. This article demonstrates how you can extend your governance approach to govern HPC.

## HPC policies

While HPC in Azure does not have any specific considerations or recommendations which would impact governance related decisions, it is important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to be aware of existing governance recommendations [for corporate policies](../../govern/corporate-policy.md).

## HPC disciplines

For approaching disciplines for HPC in Azure, follow and understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team for existing [cloud governance disciplines.](../../govern/governance-disciplines.md)

## HPC governance references

Organizations in the manufacturing or automotive space often rely on additional compliance and regulation standards like [Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-tisax).

Banking organizations will also have [data security considerations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/industries/finance/risk-grid-banking-overview#data-security-considerations-for-risk-grid-computing) that include conducting security risk assessments before placing workloads in the cloud. 

## Next steps

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
