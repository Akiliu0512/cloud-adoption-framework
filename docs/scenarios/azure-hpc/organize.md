# Organize team members for Azure high-performance computing (HPC) in Azure

HPC architecture was designed with a set of core principles.

Best practice encourages customers to create a single centralized cloud adoption strategy, using the [Cloud Adoption Framework's Organize methodology](../../organize/index.md). Align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts.

## Core principles

- **Self-service enablement:** Enable project teams to work on their own to allow agile development methods.

- **Governance:** Enforce guardrails across the Azure platform to ensure that project teams only see, change, and execute the functions within their permissions.

- **Streamlined deployments:** Ensure that common policies are available within the organization to help teams scale quickly and support teams with less experience in some core designs and artifacts.

## Roles and teams

Devise a cloud adoption team to drive all HPC technical changes to have consistency to onboarding solutions into the cloud. Best practices include having a minimum viable product (MVP) that includes a cloud governance team to balance out the cloud adoption team by ensuring platform maturity, operations, governance, and automation.

For more information, see [Mature Team Structures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/organization-structures).

## Deployment and operations

Align responsibilities for your HPC environment by developing a cross-team matrix to identify responsibility, accountability, consultancy, and informed parties.

For more information, see [Align responsibilities across teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/raci-alignment).
