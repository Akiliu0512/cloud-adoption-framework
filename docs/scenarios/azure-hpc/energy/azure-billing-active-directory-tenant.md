# Azure billing and Azure Active Directory tenants

Azure landing zones for HPC don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Active Directory tenant decisions.

It could, however, be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team to be aware of existing [enterprise enrollment or Azure Active Directory tenant decisions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-ad-tenant).

You may also want to review the [identity and access management considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-identity-and-access-management) to understand how the Azure Active Directory tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You may also want to evaluate the [resource organization considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-resource-organization) to understand how the enrollment may be organized into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
