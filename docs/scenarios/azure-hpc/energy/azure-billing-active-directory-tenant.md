# Azure Billing and Azure Active Directory Tenants

Azure landing zones for HPC do not have any specific considerations or recommendations which would impact billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant decisions.

However, it could be important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to be aware of existing [enterprise enrollment or Azure Active Directory tenant decisions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-ad-tenant).

You may also want to review the [identity and access management considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-identity-and-access-management) to understand how the Azure Active Directory tenant is applied in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You may also want to evaluate the [resource organization considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-resource-organization) to understand how the enrollment may be organized into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
