# Governance for HPC in energy industries

Azure landing zones for high-performance computing (HPC) in energy industries don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect decisions about governance.

However, it might be important to understand any decisions that your cloud platform team has made so that you're aware of existingâ€¯recommendations. For more information, see [Design area: Azure governance](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/governance.md).
