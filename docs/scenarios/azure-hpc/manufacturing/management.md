# Management for HPC in the manufacturing industry

Azure [landing zones for HPC](../ready.md) in the manufacturing industry don't have any specific considerations or recommendations that influence management decisions. Management is one of several design areas considered in this documentation.

## Previous recommendations 

Keep in mind that it could be important to understand any decisions made previously by the cloud platform team so you know about existing [management recommendations](../../../ready/landing-zone/design-area/management.md).

## Next steps

The following articles provide guidance that you might find helpful at various points throughout the cloud adoption process. They can help you succeed in the cloud adoption scenario for HPC environments in manufacturing.
