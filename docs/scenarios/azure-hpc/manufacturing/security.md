# Security for HPC in manufacturing industries

Azure landing zones for high performance computing (HPC) in manufacturing industries do not have any specific considerations or recommendations that affect decisions about security.

However, it might be important to understand any decisions that your cloud platform team has made so that you're aware of existingâ€¯recommendations. For more information, see [Design area: Security](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/security).

## Design consideration for security

 - Security rules and policies can be defined and applied based on environment, workflow, VM, physical server, and operator, including:
     - Actions controlled via user permissions and logged for audit reporting. For example, root access privileges are only granted as needed and based on the specified VMs, preventing compromise of other HPC workflows. 
     - Isolated workflows where sensitive data cannot be shared with other HPC environments, workflows, or users running on the same underlying hardware.
     - For CycleCloud deployments, additional security practices should be followed:
         - CycleCloud should be installed on a drive with only admin-group access. This will prevent non-admin users from accessing non-encrypted data. Non-admin users should not be included to this group. Ideally, access to the CycleCloud installation should be limited to only administrators.
         - Do not share CycleCloud installation across trust boundaries
         - The RBAC controls within a single CycleCloud installation may not be sufficient in a true multi-tenant environment. Use separate and isolated CycleCloud installations for each tenant with critical data.

You can define and apply security rules and policies that are based on environment, workflow, virtual machine (VM), physical server, and operator. Examples of rules and policies include:

  - Actions that are controlled by user permissions and that are logged for audit reporting. For example, root access is granted only as needed and based on the specified VMs. Scoping access in this way helps to prevent compromising other HPC workflows.

  - Isolated workflows where sensitive data cannot be shared with other HPC environments, workflows, or users even if they're on the same underlying hardware.
 
  - Additional security practices for CycleCloud deployments:

    - Only administrators should have access to the drive on which CycleCloud is installed. Limiting access to the administrators group prevents users who are not administrators from accessing non-encrypted data.

    - Do not share an installation of CycleCloud across trust boundaries. For more information about trust relationships, see [How trust relationships work for forests in Active Directory](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/concepts-forest-trust).

    - The Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) within a single installation of CycleCloud installation might not be sufficient in a true multi-tenant environment. Use separate and isolated installations of CycleCloud for each tenant that has critical data. For more information about Azure RBAC, see [What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview)
