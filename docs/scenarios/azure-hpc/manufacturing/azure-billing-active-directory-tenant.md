# Manufacturing HPC Azure Billing and Active Directory Tenants

Azure landing zones for HPC don't have any specific considerations or recommendations, which would affect billing offer decisions, enterprise enrollment, or Active Directory tenant decisions.

However, it might be important to understand decisions previously made by the cloud platform team and the existing [enterprise enrollment or Active Directory tenant decisions](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/azure-billing-ad-tenant).

You might also want to review the [identity and access management considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-identity-and-access-management) to understand how to apply the Active Directory tenant in the design of authentication and authorization solutions. You might also want to evaluate the [resource organization considerations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/eslz-resource-organization) to understand how to organize enrollment into management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups.
