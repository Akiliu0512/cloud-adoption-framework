# Azure governance for manufacturing HPC

Governance is an important part of planning for HPC workload performance. Organization in the manufacturing or automotive space often rely on additional compliance and regulation standards like Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange ([TISAX](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-tisax)) “[Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange (TISAX) - Azure Compliance | Microsoft Docs](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-tisax)”

However, it could be important to understand any decisions previously made by the cloud platform team to be aware of existing  governance recommendations.

## Azure governance in the Azure HPC landing zone accelerator

The Azure HPC landing zone accelerator implementation includes capabilities to help organizations efficiently get mature governance controls.

For example:

A management group hierarchy that groups resources by function or workload type might encourage best practices for resource consistency.

A rich set of Azure policies might enable governance controls at management group level to ensure all resources are in scope.
