# Azure high-performance computing (HPC) landing zone accelerator

The HPC  landing zone accelerator is an open-source collection of scripts & templates that you can use to automate the deployment of an environment that can provide you a base framework on which you can make further customizations to suit your business needs. It can provide a specific architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare your enterprise-scale landing zones. The landing zones adhere to the architecture and best practices of the Cloud Adoption Framework.

Customers adopt HPC in various ways. The  landing zone accelerator can be adapted to produce an architecture that fits **your** way and puts your organization on a path to sustainable scale.

## To begin, implement an enterprise-scale landing zone

The HPC  landing zone accelerator assumes that an enterprise-scale landing zone has been successfully implemented. For more information on this prerequisite, review these articles:

- [Start with Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones](../../ready/enterprise-scale/index.md)
- [Implement Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones in Azure](../../ready/enterprise-scale/implementation.md)

## What the HPC landing zone accelerator provides

The  landing zone accelerator approach to landing zones provides these assets to support your project:

- A modular approach, so that you can customize environment variables
- Design guidelines to aid in evaluating critical decisions
- The landing zone architecture
- An implementation that includes:
  - A deployable reference capable of creating the environment for your HPC deployment
  - A Microsoft-approved HPC reference implementation to test the deployed environment
