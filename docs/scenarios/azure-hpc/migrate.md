# Migrate Azure high-performance computing (HPC)

Establish a driving statement to shape migration of this technology platform. Best practice encourages customers to create a migration statement, using the [Cloud Adoption Framework's migrate methodology](../../migrate/index.md). Migrate and modernize existing workloads.

## HPC process details

Are there data points outside of a standard Azure Migrate assessment that you need to prepare for migration?

## HPC process flow

Are there Azure migrate partners that can help get the data? What about other 3rd parties?

## HPC workload specific activities

Are there specific criteria for workloads in that portfolio that would require the customer to run a well-architected review for any workloads?

## Next steps

The following list of articles will take you to guidance found at specific points throughout the cloud adoption journey to help you be successful in the cloud adoption scenario.
