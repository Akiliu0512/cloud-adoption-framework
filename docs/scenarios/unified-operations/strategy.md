# Strategic impact of unified operations

Few organizations jump straight into a cloud-native portfolio. 
For most customers, hybrid environments across multiple clouds is the undeniable reality.

You will likely be operating in a hybrid environment. 
The big decision: 
- Are you hybrid because of a one-way trip to the cloud?
- Are you hybrid by choice, supporting a mixture of assets living in public & private cloud

If you plan to be hybrid by design for the next 12 months or longer, you should consider unified operations to manage you overall digital estate.
