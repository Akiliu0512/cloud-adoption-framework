# Measure business outcomes with AppDynamics

Measuring and quantifying successful business outcomes is a crucial part of any cloud adoption strategy. Understanding an application's performance and user experience is key to measuring those business outcomes. However, accurately measuring the correlation between application performance, user experience, and business impact is often difficult, inaccurate, and time consuming.

AppDynamics can provide business insights for most use cases, and many organizations start a comprehensive cloud adoption strategy with the following use cases:

- Pre- and post-migration comparison
- Business health
- Release validation
- Segment health
- User journeys
- Business journeys
- Conversion funnels

## How AppDynamics works

Prior to migration, a small, lightweight agent is deployed alongside your applications. Agents are purpose-built for various languages such as .Net, Java, and Node.js. The agent collects performance and diagnostic data during the migration and sends it to a controller to correlate and analyze the information. Controllers can reside in a fully managed AppDynamics environment, or the customer can choose to manage them in Azure. Key user experiences are identified as 'Business Transactions', which help you to discover the baseline for normal application or business performance. Whether they're traditional server infrastructure, database, middleware components, on-premises, or in the cloud, all application components and dependencies are identified in real time for the entire application and each Business Transaction.

## Identify business metrics

To verify whether or not your applications are meeting desired business outcomes, AppDynamics can help you to define their business value and identify the key metrics that they should meet to retain their value. For example, you can baseline the sales and average order size of your e-commerce site. If these metrics dip below normal, AppDynamics will correlate the drop with potential application performance issues and help you determine the actions to fix them.

## Pre- and post-migration comparison

The cloud offers vast benefits and potential, but the first steps of a migration are often unclear and risky.Understanding the pre- and post-cloud-migration user experience and business performance helps you to adjust and stabilize both, when needed, which can help to produce successful business outcomes while reinforcing the value that Azure provides throughout your migration journey.
