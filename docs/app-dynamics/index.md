# Measure business outcomes with AppDynamics

Measuring and quantifying successful business outcomes is a crucial part of any cloud adoption strategy. Understanding application performance and user experience and its impact on those business outcomes is often a fundamental part of the equation of measuring business outcomes. However accurately measuring that correlation between application performance, user experience, and business impact is often difficult, inaccurate, and time-consuming.

Measuring and quantifying successful business outcomes is a crucial part of any cloud adoption strategy. Understanding application performance and user experience and its impact on those business outcomes is often a fundamental part of the equation of measuring business outcomes. However accurately measuring that correlation between application performance, user experience, and business impact is often difficult, inaccurate, and time-consuming.

AppDynamics can provide business insights for virtually any use case but as part of a comprehensive cloud adoption strategy many organizations start with the following key use cases:

- Pre and post mighration comparison
- Business health
- Release validation
- Segment health
- User journeys
- Business journeys
- Conversion funnels

## How AppDynamics works

A small lightweight agent is deployed alongside your applications prior to migration. Agents are purpose-built for various languages such as .Net, Java, and Node.  The agent collects performance and diagnostic data which is then sent to our controller where it is correlated and analyzed. Controllers can reside in AppDynamics fully managed environment or can optionally be managed by the customer or in Azure. Key user experiences referred to as Business Transactions are identified and application and business performance are then baselined. Baselines identify the thresholds for normal performance whether application or business performance.   All of the components and dependencies of an application, whether that is traditional server infrastructure, database, middleware components, on-premise or in the cloud are all identified in real-time both for the entire application and for each individual Business Transaction.

## Identify business metrics

To verify whether or not your applications are meeting desired business outcomes, AppDynamics enables you to define the business value of an application and identify the key metrics for value fulfillment. For example, you can baseline the sales and average order size of your e-commerce site. If these metrics dip below normal, AppDynamics will correlate the drop with potential application performance issues and help you determine what actions you need to take to fix them.

## Sample business outcomes

### Pre and post migration comparison

The cloud offers vast benefits and potential but those initial steps as part of migration can often be filled with uncertainty and risk. Understanding and ensuring the user experience achieves the desired results alongside successful business outcomes.  Clearly understanding the pre and post cloud migration user and business performance provides direct correlation with the value that Azure provides and also when necessary understanding how and where to make course corrections when appropriate.
