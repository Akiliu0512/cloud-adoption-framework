# Cloud operation and management antipatterns

Customers frequently experience common cloud adoption antipatterns while in the operation or management phase of cloud adoption. Be cautious when you introduce a new or modernized tool chain.

## Antipattern: Focusing on tooling rather than business outcomes

Introducing or modernizing IT tooling can be very exciting and pain-relieving. Measure new IT tooling to identify how it improves the business outcome. A new or modernized tool chain doesn't automatically mean that you get a faster delivery or a better business outcome.

### Example: Tooling focus antipattern

A company introduces a new, improved version of its continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. The tool makes it easier to define delivery and deployment pipelines, so you can deploy features faster. The IT department is happy to deliver a platform that speeds up the pipeline configuration. Once a business unit uses the tool, it discovers that the time to market isn't significantly better compared to the old platform. The final approval and release process isn't changed or improved.

### Preferred outcome: Business outcome definitions

To keep your technology and business goals aligned, leaders from both areas should jointly define desired outcomes. Make sure these outcomes and goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Reasonable, and Time-bound (SMART). Ensure that the outcomes and goals have an impact on technology and the business. The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure can help to [determine a proper commitment within the business](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/manage/considerations/commitment).

Don't use simple technology outputs (such as faster deployment and pipeline configurations) to measure success. Instead, use technology and business outcomes. To help with this task, see [Developer Velocity](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/developer-velocity/).
