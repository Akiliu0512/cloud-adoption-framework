# Cloud adoption antipatterns

Customers often experience cloud adoption *antipatterns*, or common missteps that occur in design, planning, or implementation when migrating to the cloud. These patterns can block innovation and prevent businesses from adopting and realizing goals.

The following table lists antipatterns and the methodologies or cloud adoption phases that these patterns commonly occur in. The linked articles provide examples of and solutions for each antipattern.
