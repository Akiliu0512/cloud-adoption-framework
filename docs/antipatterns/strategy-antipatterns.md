# Cloud strategy antipatterns

Customers frequently experience a number of common cloud adoption antipatterns while in the strategy phase of cloud adoption. These patterns can make it hard to align your IT and business strategy, and make it hard measure the success of your cloud project.

## Missing motivation

In numerous companies we find that they nowadays announce a cloud-first or cloud-only strategy, while not defining a clear picture on what they want to achieve with the newly announced strategy. Without specifying concrete KPIs and motivations within strategy development cloud projects will most certainly not be successful, as the success of the project cannot be measured.

## Example of a missing motivation

Contoso finds that their closest competitor is launching a cloud-only strategy defining that they want to have all their systems in the cloud within a year to accelerate their business. As Contoso does not want to be left behind, they now urge into strategic discussions on how to be able to adopt the cloud fast without defining concrete success criteria like cost reduction or better performing systems. As their first system is migrated to the cloud, they miss the possibility to check if the cloud strategy is successful, because they did not define what they wanted to achieve in the first place.

## Preferred outcome: defined motivations

When discussing the motivation why adopting the cloud, define concrete KPIs that need to be accomplished to be able to communicate if the strategy is successful and should be followed for more projects. To find out more about motivations, see [Why are we moving to the cloud?](../strategy/motivations.md).

## Misalignment of motivation

One of the major reasons why cloud adoptions journeys fail, is the misalignment within the company when it comes to motivation or cloud adoption triggers. While the business sees major benefits by adopting the cloud, adoption triggers are often not communicated and aligned with the IT even though these motivations do not only influence the business strategy of a company but also the IT strategy. If there is no alignment and the motivation is not documented, a cloud journey most probably fails.

### Example of misaligned motivation

Contoso starts using the cloud because the managing board has proclaimed "Cloud-First" as the future IT-Strategy. However, they have not outlined the reasons or motivations on why and how this will be beneficial for the company. Therefore, the IT department as well as the business departments are not certain why they are adopting the cloud and consequently do not work on a common goal. The arising uncertainty, especially in the IT department leads to lack of focus and willingness to adopt the cloud. The IT-Strategy gets under scrutiny because the goals have not been set and leading to more questions than answers.

### Preferred outcome: alignment

Deciding on motivations on why to adopt the cloud is essential within the cloud adoption. Motivations on why to move to the cloud should be defined by and communicated throughout the company. This leads to more acceptance within the company throughout the business and IT and can influence (technical) decisions in later stages of the cloud adoption journey. Additionally, customers should review the [cloud migration myths](../strategy/cloud-migration-business-case.md), that should be clarified and understood before building a business justification for the cloud.
