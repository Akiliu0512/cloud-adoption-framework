# Overview

Definition of governance: Governance refers to the establishment of policies within an organization to minimize risk.

## Why govern?

Governance acts as a system of protective barriers, ensuring risk management across all operations. Its primary function is to create a balanced framework that allows for autonomous decision-making within safe limits. It safeguards the organization against both accidental and deliberate internal or external threats.
