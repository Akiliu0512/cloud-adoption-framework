# Govern overview

The Govern methodology shows you how to minimize risks associated with the cloud. It outlines a process called cloud governance. Cloud governance refers to the tools and procedures you use to define, enforce, and monitor cloud governance policies. Cloud governance policies specify what should or should not take place in the cloud and manage risks in alignment with your cloud strategy. The goal of cloud governance is to progressively reduce non-compliance issues to zero.

## Why govern the cloud?

Effective cloud governance minimizes risks and streamlines cloud usage across the organization. Cloud governance ensures your cloud environment is compliant with external regulations and aligned to your broader cloud strategy. Without cloud governance, organizations may encounter increased expenses, security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and inefficient operations.

## How to govern the cloud?

This cloud governance guidance applies to organizations of all sizes, from large enterprises to startups, and across both the private and public sectors. Cloud governance is a five-step process. The first step you perform once. The last four steps you perform once to set up cloud governance and continously to maintain cloud governance.

1. *Build a governance team*: This is the first step in establishing cloud governance. It involves assembling a team of individuals responsible for setting up governance policies and procedures.

2. *Assess cloud risks*: Once the cloud governance team is in place, the next step is to evaluate potential risks associated with the use of cloud services. Consider risks unique to your business, including regulatory compliance, security, operations, cost, data, resource management, and AI. Use Azure tools to [assess cloud risks](./assess-cloud-risks.md#azure-facilitation-identifying-cloud-risks).

3. *Document cloud governance policies*: After assessing the risks, the governance team should document policies that will govern the use of cloud services. These policies set out the rules and guidelines for cloud usage to minimize identified risks.

4. *Enforce cloud governance policies*: With the policies documented, the next step is enforcement. This ensures that the use of cloud services is in line with the established governance policies. Use Azure tools to [enforce cloud governance policies](./enforce-cloud-governance-policies.md#azure-facilitation-enforcing-cloud-governance-policies-automatically).

5. *Monitor cloud governance*: The last step in the process is monitoring cloud governance. This involves regularly checking to ensure that cloud services are used according to the governance policies and adjusting as necessary. Use Azure tools to [monitor cloud governance](./monitor-cloud-governance.md#azure-facilitation-configuring-cloud-governance-monitoring) and [set up alerts for non-compliance](./monitor-cloud-governance.md#azure-facilitation-configuring-cloud-governance-alerts).

## Next step

Build a cloud governance team to oversee the process of assessing cloud risks, defining cloud governance policies, enforcing cloud governance policies, and monitoring cloud governance.
