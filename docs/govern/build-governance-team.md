# Build a cloud governance team

Establish a specialized team within IT to develop and manage governance policies. This team ensures that governance policies are effectively aligned with both business objectives and technological capabilities, fostering a balanced approach to risk and compliance.

- **Define the purpose**: The purpose is to define and continually refine governance policies.

- **Select the member**: Select a smaller, dedicated group from IT with strong business connections. The members need to have connections with business decision makers and workload teams (platform and application) to ensure a balanced governance perspective.

- **Define the scope**: Responsibilities extend across various areas like finance, security, identity, DevOps, compliance. Utilize a RACI matrix to clearly define roles and responsibilities within the governance team.

- **Define the functions**: Drive risk assessment, produce governance policies, publish, and train personnel. Help align cloud environment with IT strategy.

- **Define the authority**: Empowered to speak and act within their scope. Non-compliance should have consequences that this team can enforce.
