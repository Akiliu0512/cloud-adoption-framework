# Build a cloud governance team

Creating a cloud governance team is essential for effective management of cloud environments. Follow this step-by-step guide to establish your team.

## Select the members of the team


- *Identify key skills:* Look for individuals in IT, information security, development, DevOps and relevant teams in your organization with technical expertise and business acumen. Skills in cloud technologies, security, compliance, and finance are key.

- *Seek business connectors:* Choose members with influence on business decision-makers.

- *Sponsorship:* The significance of having an executive-level sponsor when forming a cloud governance team cannot be overstated. This high-ranking support is crucial as it ensures the necessary resources and authority are allocated to the team. Furthermore, it aids in aligning the team’s objectives with the organization’s strategic goals, fostering a culture of cloud-first thinking across the enterprise. This executive sponsorship is therefore a key factor in the successful establishment and operation of a cloud governance team.

- *Identify key skills:* Look for individuals in IT with technical expertise and business acumen. Skills in cloud technologies, security, compliance, and finance are key.
  
- *Seek business connectors:* Choose members with relationships with business decision-makers.
  
- *Diverse backgrounds:* Include members from various backgrounds like DevOps, security, compliance, and finance.

- *Size of the team:* Aim for a small, effective team.

## Define the scope of the team

- *Identify the target environments:* Will the governance rules created by this team apply to the whole organization or specific teams/geographies/business units ? Is the scope of this team focused on one or more environments (On-premises, hybrid clouds, public clouds,...etc)

- *Identify key areas:* Determine areas like FinOps, Enterprise Architecture, security, identity management, DevOps, and compliance.

  - *FinOps:* This area is responsible for managing and optimizing cloud financial operations. It ensures cost efficiency and visibility into cloud spending.

  - *DevOps:* DevOps focuses on improving collaboration between development and operations teams. It helps in automating infrastructure, workflows, and continuously measuring application performance.

  - *Security:* This area ensures that all cloud services and data are protected from threats. It implements security protocols and manages incident responses.

  - *Compliance:* Compliance ensures that cloud services meet all necessary regulations and standards. This is crucial for industries that are heavily regulated like healthcare and finance.

  - *Identity Management:* This area manages users’ identities and their access rights. It ensures that only authorized individuals have access to certain data and services.

  - *Enterprise Architecture:* This area aligns the organization’s IT strategy with its business goals. It helps in designing the IT infrastructure and guides the adoption of cloud services.

> Each of these areas plays a crucial role in the effective governance of cloud services within an organization. They work together to ensure that the organization can reap the benefits of the cloud while managing risks and costs.
  
- *Use a RACI matrix:* Develop a RACI Matrix to clarify roles and responsibilities.

- *Set clear boundaries:* Define the team’s scope to avoid overlaps or gaps.

## Define the authority of the team

- *Establish authority levels:* Define the team's decision-making powers and enforcement capabilities.

- *Communicate authority:* Ensure the organization understands the team's authority.

- *Create enforcement policies:* Develop transparent policies for non-compliance, timelines for remediation and a process for exclusions.

## Define the functions of the team

- *Environment discovery:* The team should be able to continuously discover the environment and should be involved in different conversations around new and existing workloads.

- *Policy development:* Task the team with creating and updating governance policies.

- *Risk assessment:* Conduct regular risk assessments.

- *Training and communication:* Develop training programs for adherence to governance policies.
