# Build a cloud governance team

Cloud Governance is a function, not a dedicated team:

The responsibility of cloud governance is usually carried out by a "cloud governance team". This in fact is a **function** that takes on the role of understanding cloud business and operational risks and can translate those into cloud corporate policies. In this sense, the recommendation is not that there be a dedicated team for this purpose, unless the organization determines so if necessary.
 
For organizations with a cloud strategy team, the cloud governance function is expected to collaborate strongly with them to achieve that business understanding (this may be the case when the governance team does not also serve as a strategy function cloud).
 
On the other hand, effectively managing risks is essential for any organization, and it's important to understand how much risk the organization can handle and is willing to take. This isn't just a technical decision; it's a crucial part of organizational governance. That's why cloud risk management is closely tied to the organization's overall IT and corporate governance. To ensure the best outcomes, it's recommended that Cloud Governance representatives strongly understand both cloud services and the organization's risk appetite. However, when this is not feasible, cloud technical teams can take the cloud governance initiative and work closely with the CCoE, management board or equivalent to ensure they are actively involved in the decision-making process. By working together, cloud technical teams and management boards can make informed decisions and take responsibility for cloud risk management. 
 
In this sense, when a formal cloud governance function is not yet established, it is common for the need for its formalization to be given precisely from below. This is through more technical teams that work with cloud environments and services daily and are faced with the challenge of incorporating more controls and the need to minimize risks that arise and are encountered along the cloud adoption journey.
 
Thus, the CCoE, management board (or equivalent) must intervene to ensure the development of the appropriate cloud risk management framework. They have the ultimate responsibility to the organization's stakeholders for establishing and maintaining a sufficient and proper risk management framework for the cloud. Hence, the Cloud Governance team usually develops the cloud risk management framework under the CCoE/management's oversight.

Cloud governance is fundamentally driven by the people who define, implement, and refine governance policies. To establish cloud governance, you first need to build a cloud governance team. Here are recommendations for building a cloud governance team.
Creating a tactical cloud governance team is essential for effective management of cloud environments. Tactical cloud governance is fundamentally driven by the people who define, implement, and refine governance policies. It is the linking team between the strategy the organization is pursuing in cloud and the low-level decisions that will be taken at operational level. To establish cloud governance at tactical level, you first need to build a tactical cloud governance team. Follow this step-by-step guide to establish your team.
## Understand the functions of a cloud governance team

A cloud governance team needs to perform certain essential functions in an organization. The list of functions can vary between organization, but the essentials don't. You need to understand the essential functions of the cloud governance team, so you can select the right people, grant the proper authority, and define their scope. Here's a list of essential cloud functions the cloud governance team must perform:

- *Engage stakeholders.* The governance team must actively engage with stakeholders across the organization to get input on the creation and revision of governance policies. The team should have an established feedback loop with various departments, such as IT, finance, operations, security, compliance, to ensure policies reflect the organization's needs.

- *Assess organizational risks.* It's essential for the governance team to organize regular assessments of organizational risk. The team is responsible for identifying risk to the organization and converting risks into governing corporate policies. Risk assessments must quantify the risks to the organization and prioritize the mitigation of the biggest risks. Utilizing risk assessment tools and methodologies, the team should evaluate security, compliance, and operational risks. They should schedule assessments at regular intervals and share the findings with relevant stakeholders.

- *Develop and update governance policies.* The team must create and frequently update governance policies to align with the broader IT strategy and compliance requirements as they arise. This task requires collaboration with various departments, including legal, compliance, and IT security. The goal is to ensure policies are comprehensive, enforceable, and reflective of the latest in cloud technology and regulatory landscapes.

- *Develop adoption program.* To ensure adherence to governance policies, the team must develop an adoption program for the organization. This can include, but not limited, to training materials including online courses, workshops, and documentation for different roles within the organization. Accompanied by communication plan explaining the details and the desired outcome the Governance Team will produce. The goal is to help employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining cloud governance standards and how this effects their role related activities on a daily base.

- *Establish and report on governance.* The governance team must establish metrics that measure the effectiveness of governance initiatives. They need to create a method to report their findings to management and stakeholders. For example, they could create a dashboard that tracks compliance rates, incident response times, and user satisfaction. It allows the team to measure the progress of governance efforts and identify areas for improvement.

## Select the members of the cloud governance team

With an understanding of what the functions of the cloud governance team, you can start selecting the members of your team. You need to forming a capable and effective team that can address the complex challenges of cloud governance. Here's criteria to help build your team:

- *Use IT personnel.* Select a dedicated group from within the IT department with direct responsibilities for governance. Cloud governance applies to technical resources and you want a team with expertise in areas, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, managing your cloud governance.

- *Build a small team.* Start with a small team. For example, form a core team of individuals with complementary skills covering key governance areas such as compliance, security, and cloud architecture. A smaller team encourages agility and quicker decision-making.

The structure and composition of the cloud governance team may vary depending on the size, complexity, and maturity of the cloud adoption journey. However, some common roles and responsibilities that should be considered are:

- Cloud governance lead: This is the person who oversees the cloud governance team and ensures that the cloud governance framework is aligned with the organization's goals, strategies, and policies. The cloud governance lead should have a clear vision of the cloud adoption benefits and challenges, as well as the ability to communicate and collaborate with different stakeholders across the organization.

- Cloud architect: This is the person who designs and validates the cloud architecture and ensures that it meets the technical and functional requirements, as well as the security and compliance standards. The cloud architect should have a deep knowledge of the cloud services and platforms, as well as the best practices and patterns for cloud design and deployment.

- Cloud security officer: This is the person who defines and enforces the security policies and controls for the cloud environment and ensures that they are consistent with the organization's security posture and regulations. The cloud security officer should have a strong background in information security and risk management, as well as the skills and tools to monitor and audit the cloud security status and incidents.

- Cloud compliance officer: This is the person who verifies and validates that the cloud environment and services comply with the relevant laws, regulations, and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc. The cloud compliance officer should have a thorough understanding of the compliance requirements and obligations, as well as the methods and tools to assess and report the cloud compliance level and gaps.

- Cloud finance manager: This is the person who manages and optimizes the cloud budget and spending and ensures that they are aligned with the organization's financial goals and policies. The cloud finance manager should have a solid grasp of the cloud pricing and billing models, as well as the tools and techniques to track and forecast the cloud costs and savings.

The cloud governance team should meet regularly to review and update the cloud governance framework, as well as to discuss and resolve any issues or challenges that arise from the cloud usage. The cloud governance team should also communicate and collaborate with other teams and stakeholders, such as the cloud service providers, the cloud users, the cloud champions, and the senior management, to ensure that the cloud governance framework is effective, efficient, and transparent.
## Grant authority to the cloud governance team

The cloud governance team needs the authority to enforce the governance policies they create. There should be consequences for not adhering to governance policies that the governance team can apply. Here are recommendations for granting authority to the cloud governance team:

- *Secure executive sponsorship.* Obtain commitment from an executive-level sponsor to provide the cloud governance team with necessary resources, authority, and alignment with organizational goals. For example, identify a C-level executive, such as the CIO or CTO, who can champion the governance initiative and ensure its alignment with strategic objectives. An executive sponsor helps provide the necessary resources and authority for the governance team.

- *Establish authority levels.* Define the team's decision-making powers and enforcement capabilities. For example, delineate the team’s authority to enforce compliance, manage cloud budgets, and make decisions on cloud architecture. Clear authority levels should be communicated across the organization to ensure there is no ambiguity about the team's role.

- *Create enforcement policies.* Develop transparent policies for non-compliance with organization cloud governance policies. For example, outline the procedures for addressing violations of governance policies. The procedures should outline escalation paths and potential penalties. Enforcement policies should be fair, transparent, and consistently applied. The governance team isn’t necessarily the team to make the organization adhere to that policy. Distribute the responsibility of adherence across all the workload teams.

- *Communicate authority.* Ensure the organization understands the team's authority. For example, use organization-wide announcements, include references in new hire training, the employee handbook, and conduct presentations at company meetings. Effective communication strategies ensure that all employees are aware of the governance team’s authority and its impact on their work.

## Define the scope of the cloud governance team

The cloud governance team has a specific charter to create policies that mitigate risks for the organization. You need to define the scope of the team's responsibility to they can focus on their charter and ensure their responsibilities don't overlap with the responsibilities of other teams. Here are recommendations to defining the scope of the team's responsibilities:

- *Define responsibilities.* Outline the team's role over cloud resources, services, and policies. Establishing these boundaries helps in preventing overlap with other teams and clarifies the team’s domain of influence. For example, if the cloud governance team sets cloud security policies, you should delineate the security team's role in implementing governance to enforce those policies.

- *Use a RACI matrix.* Develop a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI Matrix) to clarify roles and responsibilities within the cloud governance team. This matrix should detail who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each governance task. For example, RACI chart should include tasks such as defining cloud usage policies, where "Responsible" might be the cloud governance team for drafting the policies, "Accountable" could be the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for final approval, "Consulted" could include the legal and compliance departments for input, and "Informed" would be all cloud service users within the organization.
