# Build a cloud governance team

Cloud governance is fundamentally about the people who define, implement, and refine governance policies. To establish cloud governance, you need to build a cloud governance team first.

## Understand the functions of a cloud governance team

A cloud governance team needs to perform certain essential functions in an organization. The list of functions can vary between organization, but the essentials don't. You need to understand the essential functions of the cloud governance team, so you can select the right people, grant the proper authority, and define their scope. Here's a list of essential cloud functions the cloud governance team must oversee:

- *Engage stakeholders*: The governance team must actively engage with stakeholders across the organization to get input on the creation and revision of governance policies. The team should have an established feedback loop with various departments, such as IT, finance, and operations, to ensure policies reflect the organization's needs.

- *Assess cloud risks*: It's essential for the governance team to organize regular assessments of cloud risks. Risk assessments must quantify the risks to the organization and prioritize the mitigation of the biggest risks. Utilizing risk assessment tools and methodologies, the team should evaluate security, compliance, and operational risks. They should schedule assessments at regular intervals and share the findings with relevant stakeholders.

- *Develop and update governance policies*: The team must create and periodically update governance policies to align with the broader IT strategy and compliance requirements. This task requires collaboration with various departments, including legal, compliance, and IT security. The goal is to ensure policies are comprehensive, enforceable, and reflective of the latest in cloud technology and regulatory landscapes.

- *Develop training*: To ensure adherence to governance policies, the team must develop training programs for the organization. Training materials could include online courses, workshops, and documentation for different roles within the organization. The goal is to help employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining cloud governance standards.

- *Establish and report on governance*: The governance team must establish metrics that measure the effectiveness of governance initiatives. They need to create a method to report their findings to management and stakeholders. For example, they could create a dashboard that tracks compliance rates, incident response times, and user satisfaction. It allows the team to measure the progress of governance efforts and identify areas for improvement.

## Select the members of the team

The members of the cloud governance team 

- *Use IT personnel*: Select dedicated group from within the IT department with direct responsibilities for governance. Cloud governance applies to technical resources. IT staff possess the most comprehensive understanding of these resources and are best suited for this role.

- *Build a small team*: Start with a small team. Large teams are often inefficient. You want the team to cover all necessary governance areas without unnecessary friction.

- *Use well-connected individuals*: The team must establish and maintain strong relationships with throughout the organization. They need to engage stakeholders from both technical domains and business units. It includes stakeholders from finance, sales, security, identity management, DevOps, and compliance. The governance team need to understand the needs of platform teams and application teams. Representation from the technical teams responsible for delivery helps ensure cloud governance is relevant and effective.


## Define the authority of the team

- *Secure executive sponsorship*: Obtain commitment from an executive-level sponsor to provide the cloud governance team with necessary resources, authority, and alignment with organizational goals.
- *Establish authority levels:* Define the team's decision-making powers and enforcement capabilities.
- *Create enforcement policies:* Develop transparent policies for non-compliance.
- *Communicate authority:* Ensure the organization understands the team's authority.

## Define the scope of the team

You need to outline the specific areas of responsibility and authority of the team in managing and governing the organization's cloud environment. To define the scope of the cloud governance team, an organization should:

1. *Use a RACI matrix*: Develop a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI Matrix) to clarify roles and responsibilities within the cloud governance team. This matrix should detail who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each governance task, ensuring clear communication and accountability.

1. *Set clear boundaries*: Clearly define what the cloud governance team will and will not do. This includes setting limits on the team’s authority and outlining its jurisdiction over cloud resources, services, and policies. Establishing these boundaries helps in preventing overlap with other teams and clarifies the team’s domain of influence. By systematically addressing these steps, an organization can effectively delineate the scope of its cloud governance team, ensuring that it has a focused and clear mandate to govern the organization's cloud environment efficiently.
