# Build a cloud governance team

Cloud governance is fundamentally driven by the people who define, implement, and refine governance policies. To establish cloud governance, you first need to build a cloud governance team. Here are recommendations for building a cloud governance team.

## Understand the functions of a cloud governance team

A cloud governance team needs to perform certain essential functions in an organization. The list of functions can vary between organization, but the essentials don't. You need to understand the essential functions of the cloud governance team, so you can select the right people, grant the proper authority, and define their scope. Here's a list of essential cloud functions the cloud governance team must perform:

- *Engage stakeholders.* The governance team must actively engage with stakeholders across the organization to get input on the creation and revision of governance policies. The team should have an established feedback loop with various departments, such as IT, finance, and operations, to ensure policies reflect the organization's needs.

- *Assess organizational risks.* It's essential for the governance team to organize regular assessments of organizational risk. The team is responsible for identifying risk to the organization and converting risks into governing corporate policies. Risk assessments must quantify the risks to the organization and prioritize the mitigation of the biggest risks. Utilizing risk assessment tools and methodologies, the team should evaluate security, compliance, and operational risks. They should schedule assessments at regular intervals and share the findings with relevant stakeholders.

- *Develop and update governance policies.* The team must create and periodically update governance policies to align with the broader IT strategy and compliance requirements. This task requires collaboration with various departments, including legal, compliance, and IT security. The goal is to ensure policies are comprehensive, enforceable, and reflective of the latest in cloud technology and regulatory landscapes.

- *Develop training.* To ensure adherence to governance policies, the team must develop training programs for the organization. Training materials could include online courses, workshops, and documentation for different roles within the organization. The goal is to help employees understand their responsibilities in maintaining cloud governance standards.

- *Establish and report on governance.* The governance team must establish metrics that measure the effectiveness of governance initiatives. They need to create a method to report their findings to management and stakeholders. For example, they could create a dashboard that tracks compliance rates, incident response times, and user satisfaction. It allows the team to measure the progress of governance efforts and identify areas for improvement.

## Select the members of the cloud governance team

With an understanding of what the functions of the cloud governance team, you can start selecting the members of your team. You need to forming a capable and effective team that can address the complex challenges of cloud governance. Here's criteria to help build your team:

- *Use IT personnel.* Select a dedicated group from within the IT department with direct responsibilities for governance. Cloud governance applies to technical resources and you want a team with expertise in areas, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity, managing your cloud governance.

- *Build a small team.* Start with a small team. For example, form a core team of individuals with complementary skills covering key governance areas such as compliance, security, and cloud architecture. A smaller team encourages agility and quicker decision-making.

## Grant authority to the cloud governance team

The cloud governance team needs the authority to enforce the governance policies they create. There should be consequences for not adhering to governance policies that the governance team can apply. Here are recommendations for granting authority to the cloud governance team:

- *Secure executive sponsorship.* Obtain commitment from an executive-level sponsor to provide the cloud governance team with necessary resources, authority, and alignment with organizational goals. For example, identify a C-level executive, such as the CIO or CTO, who can champion the governance initiative and ensure its alignment with strategic objectives. An executive sponsor helps provide the necessary resources and authority for the governance team.

- *Establish authority levels.* Define the team's decision-making powers and enforcement capabilities. For example, delineate the team’s authority to enforce compliance, manage cloud budgets, and make decisions on cloud architecture. Clear authority levels should be communicated across the organization to ensure there is no ambiguity about the team's role.

- *Create enforcement policies.* Develop transparent policies for non-compliance with organization cloud governance policies. For example, outline the procedures for addressing violations of governance policies. The procedures should outline escalation paths and potential penalties. Enforcement policies should be fair, transparent, and consistently applied.

- *Communicate authority.* Ensure the organization understands the team's authority. For example, use organization-wide announcements, include references in the employee handbook, and conduct presentations at company meetings. Effective communication strategies ensure that all employees are aware of the governance team’s authority and its impact on their work.

## Define the scope of the cloud governance team

The cloud governance team has a specific charter to create policies that mitigate risks for the organization. You need to define the scope of the team's responsibility to they can focus on their charter and ensure their responsibilities don't overlap with the responsibilities of other teams. Here are recommendations to defining the scope of the team's responsibilities:

- *Define responsibilities.* Outline the team's role over cloud resources, services, and policies. Establishing these boundaries helps in preventing overlap with other teams and clarifies the team’s domain of influence. For example, if the cloud governance team sets cloud security policies, you should delineate the security team's role in implementing governance to enforce those policies.

- *Use a RACI matrix.* Develop a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI Matrix) to clarify roles and responsibilities within the cloud governance team. This matrix should detail who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each governance task. For example, RACI chart should include tasks such as defining cloud usage policies, where "Responsible" might be the cloud governance team for drafting the policies, "Accountable" could be the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for final approval, "Consulted" could include the legal and compliance departments for input, and "Informed" would be all cloud service users within the organization.
