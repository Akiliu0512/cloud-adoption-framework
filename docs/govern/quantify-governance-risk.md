# Quantify cloud risks

Assess and quantify the potential risks in the cloud environment at different organizational levels. Understanding the scope and magnitude of risks is crucial for developing governance policies that adequately protect the organization without hindering its operational efficiency.

Base the risk assessment on you organizational risk tolerance and compliance requirements.

## Assessment process

- **Risk Assessment**: Conduct comprehensive risk assessments at various scopes (workload, platform, organizational).

- **Responsibility**: Assign individuals or teams for governance at different levels, including cloud enrollment.

- **Understanding Risks**: Evaluate the cost of risks and value of mitigations; understand the likelihood and impact of risks.

- **Interviews**: Engage with different units outside IT to build a shared vision of risk.

- **Goal Setting**: Define realistic targets and understand the trade-offs between agility and control.
