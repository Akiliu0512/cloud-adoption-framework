# Build a cloud governance team

This article shows you how to build a cloud governance team. A cloud governance team oversees cloud governance for the organization. This team is responsible for assessing risks, documenting cloud governance policies, and reporting on the progress of cloud governance. They need to understand the interest of the organization and ensure cloud governance policies minimize risks. The goal is to have people accountable for the success of cloud governance.

## Define the functions of the cloud governance team

Describe the duties and roles of the cloud governance team. Outline what the team needs to implement the organization's cloud governance effectively. The cloud governance team should fulfill the following essential functions:

- *Engage stakeholders.* The cloud governance team must actively engage stakeholders across the organization (IT, finance, operations, security, and compliance) to gather input on governance policies. The goal is to ensure cloud governance policies minimize risk without hindering progress toward business goals.

- *Assess cloud risks.* The cloud governance team must assess cloud risks regularly to identify risks and prioritize them. They use or oversee the use of risk assessment tools to evaluate security, compliance, and operational risks, and communicate findings to stakeholders.

- *Develop and update governance policies*. The cloud governance team should document cloud governance policies for the organization. They should resolve any challenges cloud governance creates and must regularly review and update cloud governance policies to align with business needs over time. The goal is to ensure the cloud governance policies are comprehensive, enforceable, and align with current technology and requirements.

- *Develop a cloud governance program*. The cloud governance team should design a cloud governance program to ensure cloud governance is successful in the organization. Create a communication plan to educate employees about their roles in upholding governance standards. Develop training materials, workshops, and documentation.

- *Monitor and review governance.* Establish metrics to measure the effectiveness of cloud governance. Develop reporting methods, such as dashboards, to track compliance rates, incident response times, and user satisfaction.

## Select the members of the cloud governance team

Select the individuals responsible for overseeing and managing cloud governance within an organization. Recruit members with the skills to efficiently enforce policies, manage risks, and comply with regulations. To select members of the cloud governance team, follow these recommendations:

- *Select a small team*. Pick a small team to encourage agility and quicker decision-making.

- *Select a diverse team.* The team should consist of individuals from different areas of the organization. Consider including IT operations, security, finance, software development, cloud architecture, processes, and compliance.

- *Define team members’ responsibilities*. Define roles and responsibilities within your cloud governance team. Tailor them to your organization's size, complexity, and cloud maturity. Key areas of responsibility include cloud governance lead, cloud architecture, cloud security, cloud compliance, and cloud finance.

## Define the authority of the cloud governance team

Empower the cloud governance team to implement and oversee cloud governance. The goal is to ensure the cloud governance team has the legitimacy and support required to achieve the organization's cloud governance objectives. To define the authority of the team, follow these recommendations:

- *Secure executive sponsorship.* Gain support from and report to a named executive, such as the CIO or CTO, to support the cloud governance initiative. The executive sponsor serves as a point of escalation for challenges and helps align cloud governance with business goals.

- *Establish authority levels.* The executive sponsor should grant the team the authority to define cloud governance policies and take corrective measures for noncompliance.

- *Communicate authority.* The executive sponsor should communicate to the entire organization the governance team’s authority and the importance of adhering to governance policies they create.

## Define the scope of the cloud governance team

Establish the boundaries of the cloud governance team’s responsibility. The goal is to clarify areas of responsibility so the cloud governance team can focus on their defined functions. To define the scope, follow these recommendations:

- *Define relationship with other teams.* Clearly define the cloud governance team’s authority over cloud resources, services, and policies. Avoid conflict and overlapping responsibility with other teams.

- *Use a RACI matrix.* Use a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RACI Matrix) to delineate roles and responsibilities within the cloud governance framework. See the [example cloud governance RACI matrix](#example-cloud-governance-raci-matrix).

## Example cloud governance RACI matrix

The following table is an example of a RACI matrix for cloud governance. The matrix indicates who is responsible (R), accountable (A), consulted (C), and informed (I) across various cloud governance tasks. Create a RACI matrix that aligns to your organization and meets your specific needs.

| Task                                 | Cloud governance team     |   Executive sponsor   | Cloud platform team     | Workload teams     |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Engage stakeholders                  | R, A                      | I                     | C                       | C                  |
| Assess cloud risks                   | A                         | I                     | R                       | R                  |
| Develop & update governance policies | R, A                      | I                     | C                       | C                  |
| Report on cloud governance progress  | R, A                      | I                     | C                       | C                  |
| Cloud architecture planning          | A                         | I                     | R                       | R                  |
| Enforce governance policies          | A, C                      | I                     | R                       | R                  |
| Monitoring governance                | A, C                      | I                     | R                       | R                  |
