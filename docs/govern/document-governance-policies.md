# Document cloud governance policies

Documenting cloud governance policies effectively is essential for ensuring that an organization's cloud resources are used securely, efficiently, and in alignment with its strategic objectives. These policies serve as a blueprint for managing and operating cloud environments, particularly in platforms like Azure, where the balance between flexibility and control is crucial. Here's a structured guide on how to document these policies:

Formally record governance policies, including what is permissible and what is not within the cloud environment. Clear documentation provides a definitive reference for all stakeholders, ensuring consistency and clarity in governance and compliance efforts.

## Draft policy structure

Develop a standardized format for your policies that includes the policy statement, purpose, scope, enforcement actions, and compliance requirements.

## Draft governance policies

Determine necessary policies to mitigate high-priority risks, focusing on areas such as data breaches, compliance violations, and service disruptions.

- *Use risk register.* Begin by reviewing the risk register to understand and prioritize risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. Determine which risks can be mitigated through governance policies, focusing on those with the highest priority.

- *Translate risks into policies.* Map each identified risk to specific policy needs, ensuring coverage of all critical risk areas.

### General approach

Link each policy to specific business risks. Identify and address these risks with tailored policies. For example, if data loss is a concern, a policy might mandate regular backups. For each high-priority risk, develop a plan to mitigate, transfer, accept, or avoid the risk. This includes selecting appropriate controls and measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.

- *Use outcome-based policies.* Highlight the desired outcomes instead of prescribing specific actions, encouraging innovative compliance solutions. For instance, specify that data should be encrypted at rest without mandating the encryption method.

- *Ensure balance and value.* Design policies that provide a balance between strict control and operational flexibility. Focus on achieving valuable outcomes rather than prescriptive measures. You need policies to be flexible enough to accommodate both automation and manual control.

- *Use clear language.* Use language to clarify obligations and recommendations. Use terms like "must" and "should" to delineate requirements.
- *Create evergreen policies.* Write policies with longevity in mind, avoiding details that necessitate frequent updates. This approach ensures policies remain relevant over time.

## Understand policy impact

Documented policies shape system/workload architecture and development practices, including software hosting and library usage. This is why you should start with an audit approach to governance.

Account for system architecture impact: Recognize the influence of governance policies on system design, crafting policies that support secure and efficient architectures.
Extend to development practices: Apply governance to development activities, promoting secure hosting solutions and the use of approved third-party libraries.

  1. Governance policies can help determine which functions should be centralized. If a certain principle is applicable to most or all teams, it might be beneficial to align that principle with a centralized function.

      1. For instance, when communicating with on-premises systems, the governance policy states that the use of an ExpressRoute is mandatory. This task is beyond the scope of the workload team and should be managed by a dedicated central networking team.

      1. Another example, if several workloads are independently tasked with implementing a firewall, this repetitive requirement becomes a prime candidate for centralization. Recognizing such patterns, governance should evolve to advocate for unified, organization-wide solutions. In this case, updating the policy from a generic 'each workload must have a firewall' to a more centralized 'all workloads must utilize the corporate-approved firewall' not only ensures consistency in security measures but also streamlines operations and potentially reduces costs

## Communicate policies

- Engage stakeholders: Communicate the importance and requirements of governance policies to stakeholders, highlighting their impact on the organization.
- Develop training programs: Create training initiatives to educate employees on governance policies, emphasizing their roles in compliance and enforcement.
Adhering to this structured guide enables organizations to develop comprehensive, clear, and practical cloud governance documentation. This documentation not only supports strategic objectives and risk mitigation but also promotes a culture of compliance and security within the cloud environment.

## Review and update

- *Facilitate change control.* Include a process for policy review and updates, ensuring they stay aligned with organizational and technological changes.
- *Schedule regular reviews.* Regularly review governance policies to ensure they align with evolving organizational needs, risks, and cloud advancements.
- *Implement feedback mechanisms. Establish channels for collecting feedback on policy effectiveness and applicability, engaging with stakeholders across the organization.

- **Key Areas**: Focus on identity, security, compliance, and cost.

- *Identify key areas:* Determine areas like FinOps, Enterprise Architecture, security, identity management, DevOps, and compliance.

  - *FinOps:* This area is responsible for managing and optimizing cloud financial operations. It ensures cost efficiency and visibility into cloud spending.

  - *DevOps:* DevOps focuses on improving collaboration between development and operations teams. It helps in automating infrastructure, workflows, and continuously measuring application performance.

  - *Security:* This area ensures that all cloud services and data are protected from threats. It implements security protocols and manages incident responses.

  - *Compliance:* Compliance ensures that cloud services meet all necessary regulations and standards. This is crucial for industries that are heavily regulated like healthcare and finance.

  - *Identity Management:* This area manages users’ identities and their access rights. It ensures that only authorized individuals have access to certain data and services.

  - *Enterprise architecture:* This area aligns the organization’s IT strategy with its business goals. It helps in designing the IT infrastructure and guides the adoption of cloud services.

> Each of these areas plays a crucial role in the effective governance of cloud services within an organization. They work together to ensure that the organization can reap the benefits of the cloud while managing risks and costs.


## Example policies

- Security policies: Define requirements for identity and access management, data encryption, network security controls, and incident response.
- Compliance policies: Document policies to ensure adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2).
- Cost Management policies: Outline procedures for monitoring, allocating, and optimizing cloud costs.
- Operational policies: Specify standards for performance, reliability, and resource utilization.
- Change Management policies: Establish procedures for making changes in the cloud environment, including review, approval, and deployment processes.

-	No individual is allowed to purchase Azure directly. I govern cloud usage and created my own subscription and started putting on a billing code internally. Must follow the official procurement process
-	All subscriptions must follow co-ownership model. You can’t have a subscription without platform-team visibility.
-	All VMs must have patches up to date no more 30 days old.
-	All VMs must not support SSH/RDP via the internet. 
Follow on notes: some of it’s operations, some of it’s configuration, typology. Governance can span more than just configuration and deployments. It can have widespread application. 
-	Region restrictions based on risks.
