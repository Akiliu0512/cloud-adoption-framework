# Measure compliance with governance policies

Immediately after documenting governance policies, you need to implement mechanisms to monitor compliance with governance policies and report on their effectiveness. This involves ensuring that you are governing what you are looking at, reporting on the progress of policy adherence, and building reports to track the delta between where you want to be and where you are.

- **Focus of Reporting**: Report only on areas that are being monitored and governed.

- **Implementation and Measurement**: Develop reporting mechanisms to track policy adherence and progress. Incorporate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are agreed upon by both business and IT. Ensure that the right aspects are being monitored, such as cost reduction or development speed.

- **Communication**: Share policies widely and ensure educational components are included for better compliance.

- **Tracking Over Time**: Monitor and track governance effectiveness and progress over time.

## Monitor and review

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement tools and processes to continuously monitor the risk landscape for changes that may affect the risk assessment.
- **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of the risk assessment to update it based on new threats, vulnerabilities, and changes in the organization's cloud environment.
