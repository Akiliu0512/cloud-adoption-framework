# Conduct a risk assessment

A risk assessment is foundational to effective cloud governance. By systematically identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks, organizations can ensure that their governance framework addresses the most critical threats to their cloud environments. This process involves identifying potential threats to your organization's information and systems in the cloud and evaluating the likelihood and impact of these threats to prioritize mitigation efforts. 

The cloud governance team's first deliverable is establishing a quantified understanding of business risks. They must document the cost of risks and the value of mitigation strategies. THey must oversee risk assessment tasks across the organization. The goal is to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of threats while using specialized knowledge and insights from various departments. This collaborative approach enables the organization to craft a governance vision that reflects its specific risks and risk tolerance. Here's  guidance on how to conduct a risk assessment for cloud governance:

## Identify risks

- *Gather data.* The cloud governance team should coordinate efforts to collect information about potential risks. This includes conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders across the organization to understand different perspectives on cloud-related threats.

- *Conduct an inventory.* A detailed inventory of cloud-based assets should be compiled, encompassing applications, data, and infrastructure components. The governance team will oversee this process, ensuring completeness and accuracy.

- *Identify threats.* Threat modeling techniques are applied to each asset to identify potential external and internal threats. While the governance team guides this process, it relies on input from various parts of the organization to understand specific vulnerabilities and threats. Consider both external threats (e.g., cyber attacks) and internal threats (e.g., unauthorized access by employees).

## Analyze risks

- *Evaluate risk probability.* Evaluate the probability of each identified risk occurring. Consider factors like exposure to threats, existing controls, and historical data. The governance team coordinates this analysis but may require specialized input from security experts and department heads.

- *Determine risk impact.* Determine the potential impact of each risk on the organization. This includes financial loss, reputational damage, operational disruption, and legal implications. The cloud governance team, in collaboration with finance, legal, and operational leaders, assesses these impacts to understand the broader organizational consequences.

- *Generate risk rating.* A risk rating (e.g., low, medium, high) is assigned to each risk based on its likelihood and impact. The governance team oversees this process, ensuring a consistent methodology across the organization.

## Prioritize risks

- *Use a risk matrix.* A risk matrix helps visualize and prioritize risks based on their ratings. The cloud governance team uses this tool to focus the organization's attention and resources on the most critical risks.

- *Assess business impact.* The strategic importance of affected assets and the organization's overall risk tolerance are considered to refine risk prioritization. The governance team, in consultation with senior management, leads this assessment to align risk priorities with business objectives.

## Document risks

- *Create a risk register.* A comprehensive risk register is created, documenting all identified risks, their assessments, and prioritization. The cloud governance team ensures that the register includes descriptions of risks, their causes, potential impacts, likelihoods, and priorities.

- *Communicate with stakeholders.* The governance team is responsible for communicating the findings to key stakeholders, including senior management and affected business units. This ensures a shared understanding of risks across the organization and fosters a collaborative approach to managing cloud governance.
