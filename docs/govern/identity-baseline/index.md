# Identity Baseline discipline overview

Identity baseline is one of the [Five Disciplines of Cloud Governance](../governance-disciplines.md) within the [Cloud Adoption Framework governance model](../index.md). 

Identity services provide the core mechanisms supporting access control and organization within IT environments, and the Identity Baseline discipline complements the [Security Baseline discipline](../security-baseline/index.md) by consistently applying authentication and authorization requirements across cloud adoption efforts.
