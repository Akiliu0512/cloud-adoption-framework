# Plan for sustainability

TBD.

## Identify current emissions

To plan for a more sustainable path forward in your cloud adoption journey, consider existing emissions to measure them over time as you move workloads to the cloud or between cloud providers.

### Identify the most carbon-emitting workloads

One key criterion for prioritization of migration workload can be current carbon emissions. From a cloud efficiency and sustainability perspective, the highest emitters should be prioritized to migrate first to the cloud, maximizing the ROI early in the migration journey.

#### Capture initial Emissions Impact Dashboard baseline

TODO.

## Roles and responsibilities

TBD.

### Nominate a sustainability lead

Have you defined the person leading the charge for sustainability in your organization?

The role of the Chief Sustainability Officer is evolving. It will likely be pivotal in the future as organizations navigate the complexity of delivering on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments.

 It can be the Chief Sustainability Officer if that role exists in your organization. However, it can be anyone ultimately responsible and accountable for sustainability in the cloud. See [making sustainability part of everybody's job](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/make-sustainability-part-of-everybody-s-job/ba-p/3146718).

**Consider nominating a lead** for your sustainability efforts and teams, helping your business have a sustainability focal point. Organizations often have small silos of interested parties, and sustainability is such a task that requires everyone to be participating and work together. Some organizations are beginning their ESG journey, and there might not be a dedicated budget for a Chief Sustainability Officer role. Instead, building a virtual community across the business and dedicating someone to take the lead is a significant first step to consider.

### Define a clear RACI

Consider evolving the traditional organization structure by introducing sustainability practices within the company.
For example, the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) can encompass the directions for setting up the sustainability practice.

The governance team can define the accountabilities around ensuring the sustainability targets are [being tracked and progressed](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/okr#examples-of-okrs).

### Build green teams

Initiate the idea of building "green teams" that can have different sustainability metrics depending on the served domain, not dependent on the central sustainability team guidance but contributing to the overall green targets of the company.

#### Goals and metrics for teams owning sustainability

At Microsoft, we have a dedicated [sustainability science team](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/sustainability-science-team/) whose mission is to ensure that our sustainability work is grounded in the best available science. This drives our work in sustainability, from our climate commitments to partnering with our customers and partners on co-designing new solutions.

Establishing goals and metrics for teams owning sustainability in your organization is essential. Metrics can include greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint data, water use, and energy consumption.

The ultimate responsibility for measuring and owning these goals rests with the sustainability team, who will align with the company's sustainability strategy set by the board.

## Skilling

Scale up the green skills knowledge for customers and employees to support the related discussions.  
Expertise and awareness should be shared throughout the organization, not only targeting the dictated sustainability team.

### Build a sustainability community

Teams need to be aware of new advancements in sustainability constantly.
Building a community around cloud efficiency and green software is a good starting point to foster awareness and drive a sustainability culture across your organization. See [how do I start a sustainability community in my organization?](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/sustainable-software/how-do-i-start-a-sustainability-community/).

The sustainability community members might be separate from the central organization's sustainability team. However, strategic messaging should flow to the community. Additionally, feedback, initiatives, and suggestions should be fed from the community back into the teams accountable for sustainability. See sustainability [community and knowledge sharing](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-operational-procedures#community-and-knowledge-sharing) in the Azure Well-Architected Framework.

### Learning resources

- Sustainability, or cloud efficiency, is a fundamental topic to understand to optimize your cloud infrastructure, applications, and workloads. Learn how with the Microsoft Learn module [The Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering](/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/).
- You might also benefit from reading the report on [Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap: Helping businesses move from pledges to progress](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/11/02/closing-sustainability-skills-gap/).
- Learn more about why educating your teams about sustainability is essential. See [make sustainability part of everybody's job](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/make-sustainability-part-of-everybody-s-job/ba-p/3146718).

## Define reporting standards

Defining standards can ease the cultural pushback in implementing green IT and prioritize sustainability. For example, updating old legacy systems can be costly.

To standardize reporting, it's essential to define reporting standards and visualize the emissions to help justify decisions related to sustainability.

For example, measure direct impact by looking at the current on-premises data center Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Compare to the emissions of migrating to the cloud. You can also look at indirect emissions like the supply chain lifecycle.

To report emissions, you can use existing frameworks and regulations, such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

## Risk management

A company's level of climate risk might impact business operations.

- Aligning the company's sustainability progress/commitments with the business/stakeholder interests.
