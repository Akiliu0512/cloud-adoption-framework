# Plan for sustainability

TBD.

## Identify current emissions

To plan for a more sustainable path forward in your cloud adoption journey, take existing emissions into account so you can measure them over time as you move workloads to the cloud, or between cloud providers.

### Identify the most carbon-emitting workloads

One key criterion for prioritization of migration workload can be current carbon emission. From a cloud efficiency and sustainability perspective, the highest emitters should be prioritized to migrate first to cloud, thereby maximizing the ROI early in the migration journey.

#### Capture initial Emissions Impact Dashboard baseline

TODO.

## Roles and responsibilities

TBD.

### Define a clear RACI

Consider evolving the traditional organization structure by introducing sustainability practices within the company.
For example, the Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) can encompass the directions for setting up the sustainability practice.

The governance team can  define the accountabilities around ensuring the sustainability targets are [being tracked and progressed](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/business-outcomes/okr#examples-of-okrs).

### Build green teams

Initiate the idea of building “green teams” that can have different sustainability metrics depending on the served domain, not dependent of the “central sustainability team” guidance, but contributing to the overall green targets of the company.

#### Goals and metrics for teams owning sustainability

At Microsoft, we have a dedicated [sustainability science team](https://www.microsoft.com/research/project/sustainability-science-team/) whose mission is to ensure that our sustainability work is grounded in the best available science. This drives our work in sustainability, from our climate commitments to partnering with our customers and partners on co-designing new solutions.

Establishing goals and metrics for teams owning sustainability in your organization is important. Metrics can include emissions like greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint data, water use, and energy consumption.

The ultimate responsibility for measuring and owning these goals rests with the sustainability team who will align to the company's sustainability strategy set by the board. Consider [nominating a lead and build a team]().

## Skilling

Scaling up the green skills knowledge in order for customers and employees to support the related discussions on the topic.  
Knowledge and awareness to be shared throughout the organization, not only targeting the dictated sustainability team.

### Build a sustainability community

Depending on roles across the business, there will be different training requirements for sustainability and cloud efficiency, whether they are part of the main organization's sustainability teams or a community member.

- Set up a way of communication so community members can share what they've learned with the wider team.

### Learning resources

- Sustainability, or cloud efficiency, is a fundamental topic to understand to optimize your cloud infrastructure, applications, and workloads. Learn how with the Microsoft Learn module [The Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering](/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/).
- You might also benefit from reading the report on [Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap: Helping businesses move from pledges to progress](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/11/02/closing-sustainability-skills-gap/).
- Learn more about why educating your teams around sustainability is important. See [make sustainability part of everybody's job](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/green-tech-blog/make-sustainability-part-of-everybody-s-job/ba-p/3146718).

## Reporting standards


### Define standards

Defining standards can ease the cultural pushback in implementing green IT and prioritize sustainability (e.g., updating old legacy systems can be costly).

Goals examples:  

- Direct impact measurement (e.g. current on-prem DCs PUE and GHG emissions).
- Indirect (supply chain lifecycle).

To accomplish this, you can use existing frameworks and regulations. For example, using the Greenhouse Gas protocol on the format of reporting emissions.

## Risk management

A company's level of climate risk might bring an impact to business operations.

- Aligning the company’s sustainability progress/commitments with the business/stakeholder interests.
