# Industry Priority Scenarios

Industry Priority Scenarios (IPS) represent Microsoft’s approach to current addressable needs within the retail industry. Each scenario is backed by products and services within our portfolio that enable retail organizations to solve those challenges and drive digital transformation forward. 


There are four Industry Priority Scenarios for retail:
- Know your customers 
- Empower your employees
- Deliver intelligent supply chain
- Reimagine retail


|Industry Priority Scenario (IPS)|Know your customers|Empower your employees|Build a resilient supply chain|Reimagine retail|
|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------|
|Key message|                    Create digital experiences,and use AI and predictive analytics to anticipate evolving customer needs and deliver individualized interactions across channels|Enable secure digital collaboration across your business and reduce costs|Gain visibility across your end-to-end supply chain using technology solutions|Create innovative customer experiences, optimize in-store operations, and use technology to evolve products, services, and business models|

## Know your customers

Great customer service is—and has long been—the core art of retail. But the way consumers engage with retailers has changed, and the way retailers get to know them along with it. Fortunately, data and predictive AI offers retailers the opportunity to create digital customer experiences that take customer service to the next level while unlocking new business opportunities.

- Will central IT, a cloud center of excellence (CCoE), or other forms of centralized operations be responsible for operating all workloads?
- Does your strategy and plan require your brick and mortar locations to be integrated into your cloud environment?
- Does your strategy and plan include any deployments that require adherence to regulatory compliance standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)?

## Empower your employees

The retail industry is undergoing unprecedented change. As the pace of business continues to quicken, the importance of arming employees at every level with secure, compliant tools only grows. Retailers that embrace analytics, AI, and virtual desktop technology to address this need position themselves to ensure secure digital collaboration while reducing costs.

A large part of empowering employees is equipping them with helpful tools and insights—regardless of their role or location. Whether they’re a line-of-business contributor working from home or a firstline worker helping a customer in-store, the right equipment and information are critical to delivering impeccable customer service, building customer trust and loyalty, and ultimately growing sales. 


## Build a resilient supply chain

The clock speed in retail is getting faster. The average consumer now expects near-instant gratification from both their online and in-store shopping experiences. For retailers, this means that working toward a more resilient supply chain is critical. They must be able to respond to customer demand for fast and flexible delivery and get the right product, to the right place, at the right time. And if anything goes wrong, they must be able to quickly determine potential end-customer exposure as well as the fault point in the supply chain to build and maintain customer loyalty. 

The ability to successfully leverage vast, multi-variate, real-time, and trusted data and algorithms to best find correlations and make predictions is key to gaining agility and resilience in the end-to-end supply chain and fulfilling customer demand at scale. The use case information that follows is a helpful example of how Delivering intelligent supply chain changes the game for retailers.  


## Reimagine retail

While there’s no crystal ball to help us predict what customers will demand next, there are actions that retailers can take today to evolve their products, services and business models in ways that are likely to stick. 

The retailers who will be successful tomorrow are embracing digital transformation today to reimagine retail and plan for their future today. This means not just adopting the latest technology (AI, IoT, Open APIs, and more), but implementing business models that are truly transformative and building in-house digital capabilities on top of that technology. It’s these digital capabilities that will form the foundation for continued viability. 
To illustrate just one aspect of what’s possible when reimagining retail, the rest of this section will detail a use case.
