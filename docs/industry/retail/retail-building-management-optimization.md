# Building management optimization in the retail industry

The moving parts in retail are many. From customer movement to the status of products and store devices, it’s important for retailers to understand their retail space to provide innovative customer experiences and optimize in-store operations.

## Business outcomes of building management

Real-time data from in-store sensors and IoT beacon technology empowers retailers to create a smart, connected store environment and optimize building management. These technologies make it possible to track everything from store occupancy and checkout line patterns to energy usage and maintenance needs.

It’s this real-time observational data that empowers retailers to:

- **Make more informed decisions** Harnessing real-time analytics and alerts about energy usage and warehouse operations empowers data-driven decisions.
- **Improve marketing ROI** Optimizing the use of available store space enhances retailers’ abilities target and increase the efficiency of advertising and marketing. 
- **Provide optimal shopping experiences** Triggering alerts based on real-time data from video cameras, beacon technology, and IoT sensors improves the customer experience.
- **Reduce energy costs** Applying analytics and AI to unlock insights and visualize data for quicker decision making increases the efficiency of store and warehouse operations.

## Building management optimization challenges

The problem for most retail establishments today is that they lack visibility into physical assets (security cameras, shelves, lighting, equipment, etc.)—a limitation that impacts store performance and profitability. 

Examples of challenges that retailers must navigate as a result are as follows:

- Not being able to determine the store’s busiest cash register stands in the way of optimizing customer flow across all registers.
- Lack of visibility into occupancy levels inhibits the ability to comply with social distancing requirements.
- Inability to effectively monitor energy consumption negatively impacts efforts to manage costs and advance sustainability initiatives. 
To successfully navigate these hardships, retailers must embrace advances in analytics, AI, IoT, and other technologies—and join forces with the right technology partner.
