# Building management optimization in the retail industry

It's important for you as a retailer to understand your retail space. You can provide innovative customer experiences and optimize in-store operations. From customer movement to the status of products and store devices, there are many the elements of retail to follow.

## Business outcomes of building management

In-store sensors and IoT beacon technology help track everything from store occupancy and checkout line patterns to energy usage and maintenance needs. These technologies allow you to create a smart, connected store environment and optimize building management.

Real-time observational data allows retailers to take action.

- Make more informed decisions. You can harness real-time analytics and alerts about energy usage and warehouse operations.
- Improve marketing ROI. You can optimize store space to enhance your ability to target and increase advertising and marketing efficiency.
- Provide optimal shopping experiences. Improve customer experience based on real-time data from video cameras, beacon technology, and IoT sensors.
- Reduce energy costs. Increase the efficiency of store and warehouse operations by applying analytics and AI. Visualize data for quicker decision making.

## Building management optimization challenges

Many retail establishments lack visibility into physical assets, such as security cameras, shelves, lighting, and equipment. This limitation impacts store performance and profitability.

There are challenges that you must navigate as a result, such as the following examples:

- Being unable to determine the store's busiest cash register. This problem makes it hard to optimize customer flow for all registers.
- Inability to see occupancy levels inhibits compliance with social distancing requirements.
- Being unable to monitor energy consumption impacts efforts to manage costs and advance sustainability initiatives.

Retailers can embrace advances in analytics, AI, IoT, and other technologies. You can also join forces with the right technology partner.
