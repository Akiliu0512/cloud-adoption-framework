# Implementing a data management and analytics approach in retail

As both the retail industry and the cloud computing industry mature, an emerging opportunity presents itself to accelerate the pace towards a cohesive data-driven retail business. Data and AI capabilities are most effective when data is available from throughout the retail value chain. Answering questions such as individual consumer product affinity, advertising effectiveness and item forecast needs require access to data gathered throughout the consumer shopping journey. The entire retail ecosystem benefits from having a well-understood view of this journey.  

When retail domains want to interact within the shopper journey without the legacy approach of creating a department-specific view of the journey, they turn to an approach that harmonizes the data into a cohesive data model. Understanding that the value of retail data is in the data itself, Microsoft believes having an open data model for both internal and external solution providers—one that ensures data is only visible to the entities that require it and natively manages read/write privileges—allows for rapid, secure deployment of solutions. While this concept of implementing a master data management (MDM) program to harmonize data is certainly not new, Microsoft believes that the retail industry is ready to start capitalizing on this approach.
