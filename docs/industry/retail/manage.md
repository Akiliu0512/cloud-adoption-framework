# Managing the cloud for the Retail industry

Describe how your scenario changes operations management

## Business alignment within the Retail industry

Does this scenario require the customer to rethink business alignment or how the platform is supported in operations management?

## Operations baseline for the Retail industry

Does this workload have special requirements for Visibility, Operational Compliance, or BCDR?

## Platform operations for the Retail industry

Are there specific requirements for operations of the landing zone or platform for this scenario?

## Workload operations for the Retail industry

Are there specific requirements for operations of the individual workloads running on this platform?

## Next step: Your next migration iteration

Once the the Retail industry migration is complete, the cloud adoption team can begin your next scenario-specific migration. Alternatively, if there are addition platforms to be migrated, this article series can be used again to guide your next the Retail industry migration or deployment.
