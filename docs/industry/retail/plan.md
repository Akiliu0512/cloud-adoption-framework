# Cloud adoption plan for the retail industry

The Cloud Adoption Framework Plan methodology helps create an overall cloud adoption plan. A plan guides the programs and teams involved in your cloud-based digital transformation. This guidance provides templates for creating your backlog and plans for building skills across your teams. This article helps develop a refined plan that offers guidance for the retail industry. For more information, see [Develop a cloud adoption plan](../../plan/index.md).

## Plan for digital transformation outcomes

As both the retail industry and cloud computing mature, your organization can accelerate towards becoming a cohesive data-driven retail business. Data and AI capabilities are most effective when data is available from throughout the retail value chain. This approach includes all workloads, applications, and connected shopper experiences. Questions about consumer product affinity, advertising effectiveness, and  forecast needs require access to data throughout the shopping process. The entire retail ecosystem benefits from having a well-understood view of this journey.

Retail domains can interact in the shopping process without creating a department-specific view of that process. Retailers can create a cohesive data model. Microsoft believes in an open data model for internal and external solution providers. Such a model ensures data is visible only those parties that require it. The model manages read/write privileges and allows for rapid deployment of solutions. The retail industry is ready to capitalize on this approach in the cloud maturity model.

## Align program planning horizons with cloud maturity

Cloud adoption is a catalyst for digital transformation across the retail industry. Planning for digital transformation of a business requires more than basic project planning. Project management needs to organize several programs, which create waves or horizons of change.

Retailers can connect those horizons to the maturity levels of the retail cloud maturity model. This model provides a program plan that which aligns efforts across the business and IT. Using this model also allows your business to prepare for planned changes in manageable stages in the image below. For more information, see [Cloud maturity model for retail](./retail-cloud-maturity.md).

- Connected retail

  Migrate and modernize technology solutions to enable advanced innovations and reduce operational overhead.

- Analytics-driven retail

  Align to a common data model, unlocking advanced analytics while improving data governance.

- Intelligent retail

  Deliver intelligent retail experiences that integrate AI and machine learning into custom applications and Microsoft retail cloud offerings.

## Integrate actionable program plans

To deliver the business promises of each cloud maturity horizon, integrate program plans. Successful programs require actionable plans that extend your strategy, project plans, environmental controls, adoption projects, and your overall operating model. Use the following technology platform scenarios to extend the cloud adoption scenario for retail. These scenarios add the detailed plans for programs required to reach the target horizon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The resources here are multi-page guides that outline complex technology scenarios. These scenarios can be integrated into your cloud adoption plans to guide programs. Complete your cloud adoption strategy, cloud adoption plan, and define your target horizons before exploring the following scenarios.

- Connected retail

  You can add various migration scenarios to your migration process to help reach a connected retail maturity. Retailers often integrate the hybrid and multicloud scenario to include hosting options in the migration program. For more information, see [The One Migration approach to migrating the IT portfolio](../../scenarios/index.md) and [Introduction to hybrid and multicloud](../../scenarios/hybrid/index.md).

- Analytics-driven retail

  The Data Management and Analytics scenario (coming soon) can help centralize, govern, and analyze your complex data portfolio.

- Intelligent retail

  The Modern Applications scenario (coming soon) guides citizen developers, professional developers, and DevOps teams as they improve retail workflows and functions.

## Build on planning basics

Whatever your target horizon, basic cloud adoption planning helps prepare each program for success. Include the following tasks in your planning efforts:

- Understand you current state

  Rationalize your digital estate against your planning horizons to understand how each program affects your portfolio. For more information, see [Gather inventory data for a digital estate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/inventory).

- Build a plan

  Create a DevOps backlog and cloud adoption plan to track and manage each program. For more information, see [Cloud adoption plan and Azure DevOps](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/template).

- Develop skills

  Establish a skill plan to prepare your staff for success. For more information, see [Get started on a skills readiness path](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/suggested-skills).
