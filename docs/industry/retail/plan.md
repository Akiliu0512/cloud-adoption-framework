# Cloud adoption plan for the Retail industry

[Cloud Adoption Framework's Plan methodology](../../plan/index.md) helps create an overall cloud adoption plan to guide the programs and teams involved in your cloud-based digital transformation. This guidance provides templates for creating your backlog and plans for building necessary skills across your teams, all based on what you are trying to do in the cloud. This article will aid in developing a refined plan with specific guidance for the retail industry.

## Plan for digital transformation outcomes

As both the retail industry and the cloud computing industry mature, an emerging opportunity presents itself to accelerate the pace towards a cohesive data-driven retail business. Data and AI capabilities are most effective when data is available from throughout the retail value chain across all workloads, applications, and connected shopper experiences. Answering questions such as individual consumer product affinity, advertising effectiveness and item forecast needs require access to data gathered throughout the consumer shopping journey. The entire retail ecosystem benefits from having a well-understood view of this journey.  

When retail domains want to interact within the shopper journey without the legacy approach of creating a department-specific view of the journey, they turn to an approach that harmonizes the data into a cohesive data model. Microsoft believes having an open data model for both internal and external solution providers, one that ensures data is only visible to the entities that require it and natively manages read/write privileges, allows for rapid, secure deployment of solutions. Microsoft believes that the retail industry is ready to start capitalizing on this approach across each horizon of the cloud maturity model.

## Program planning horizons aligned to the retail cloud maturity model

Cloud adoption is a catalyst for digital transformation across the retail industry. Planning for digital transformation of a business requires more than basic project planning. To achieve digital transformation, the project management office will need to successfully execute a number of programs, creating waves or horizons of change.

For retail customers, we map those horizons to the maturity levels of the [retail cloud maturity model](./retail-cloud-maturity.md). This model provides a program plan, which aligns efforts across the business and IT. Adhering to this model also allows the business to prepare for planned change in manageable stages listed in the image below.

[![Retail cloud maturity](./media/maturity-model.png)](./retail-cloud-maturity.md)

- **Connected Retail** Migrate and modernize technology solutions to enable advanced innovations & reduce operational overhead.
- **Analytics-driven Retail** Align to a common data model, unlocking advanced analytics while improving data governance.
- **Intelligent Retail** Deliver intelligent retail experiences integrating AI and ML into custom applications and Microsoft's retail cloud offerings to drive more value for your customers.

## Integrate actionable program plans

Delivering the business promises of each cloud maturity horizon requires integration of holistic program plans. Successful program execution requires actionable plans that extend your strategy, project plans, environmental controls, adoption projects, and your overall operating model. The cloud adoption scenario for retail can be extended through the use of the following technology platform scenarios, which add the detailed plans for each of the programs required to reach the target horizon.

> The links below will navigate to multi-page guides outlining complex technology scenarios, which can be integrated into your cloud adoption plans to guide a number of programs. Complete your cloud adoption strategy, cloud adoption plan, and define your target horizons before exploring the following scenarios.

- **Connected Retail** A variety of [migration scenarios](../../scenarios/index.md) can be added to your migration process to accelerate your journey to a connected retail maturity. Commonly, retail customers will also integrate the [hybrid and multicloud scenario](../../scenarios/hybrid/index.md) to include a number of hosting options in their migration program.
- **Analytics-driven Retail** The Data Management and Analytics scenario (coming soon) can aid in centralizing, governing, and analyzing your complex data portfolio.
- **Intelligent Retail** The Modern applications scenario (coming soon) can guide citizen developers, professional developers, and DevOps teams as they innovate to improve a variety of retail workflows and functions.

## Build on planning basics

Regardless of the target horizon, the basics on cloud adoption planning will help prepare each program for success. The following are a few tasks that should be included in planning efforts:

- **Understand you current state:** [Rationalize your digital estate](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/digital-estate/inventory) against your planning horizons to understand how your portfolio will be impacted by each program.
- **Build a plan:** Create a [DevOps backlog and cloud adoption plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/template) to track and manage each program.
- **Develop skills:** Establish a [skilling plan](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/plan/suggested-skills) to prepare your staff for success.
