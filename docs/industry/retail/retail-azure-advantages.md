# Azure for Retail

We are at an inflection point unlike any other that we’ve seen before. Retail is being reimagined. The challenges are real: intense industry disruption, changing consumer expectations, and the need for differentiation to stay relevant. But the opportunities are endless.

Microsoft enables retail organizations to transform their business and deliver extraordinary customer service using an intelligent, trusted, and secure cloud platform.

[Microsoft Azure offers a wide range of products and services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/), all with the speed and scale of the cloud. Our databases and storage services make it possible to connect and combine data silos. This enables the creation of a digital feedback loop—wherein digital signals (e.g. customer demand, commerce, payments, and distribution) can be captured across the retail value chain and data can be connected and synthesized to drive improved business outcomes.

We also have advanced analytics and AI solutions that help retailers gain actionable intelligence and develop intelligent applications. We have a leading position in key 21st century technologies like IoT, blockchain, and mixed reality. For developers, we have a comprehensive set of tools that can be used in with any platform or language to build and manage cloud applications. 

We aren’t limited to public cloud either – we provide unique hybrid capabilities that provide the flexibility to innovate in any environment. Microsoft is unique in offering cloud services delivered at the edge or in premise. This edge computing environment is compelling for retail organizations that need both modern services and the resiliency that on-site computing offers environments such as stores and distribution centers that operate 24x7. Security, privacy, compliance, and manageability are key differentiators across our portfolio.

There are several providers with exciting capabilities in the retail cloud space, to be sure; however, the reality is that most of them offer only a subset of what’s required to achieve true transformation. Additionally, their business models are often rooted in revenue derived from either advertising or commerce—which means that, to some degree, they are competing with retailers. 

Microsoft is the only cloud provider to offer all the capabilities retailers need to modernize. And our business model is about contribution—not competition. Our success is contingent upon our customers’ success, and we draw on the learnings gleaned from our own digital transformation to help customers reach the best possible outcomes with theirs.
