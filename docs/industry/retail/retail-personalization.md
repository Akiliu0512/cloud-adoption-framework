# Personalization in the retail industry

Personalization 
Today’s digitally savvy consumers understand they can have it all. From product research to purchase convenience—from shipment tracking to return optimization—customers are leveraging digital means wherever possible and expect businesses to instantly react to all their needs and wants. Alongside their desire for personalized services, shoppers are increasingly concerned about privacy in the wake of corporate and social data breaches. 
As consumer behavior and expectations continue to evolve, retailers must seek new ways of understanding and meeting them. Delivering personalization across multiple channels to increase the relevance of offers and improve customer experiences is no longer just a competitive advantage—it’s imperative to survival in the retail business.
Business outcomes of personalization
Deep personalization gives retailers what’s needed to thrive in today’s market. By developing a single view of customers, they gain the tools to engage customers at the right time, in the right place, with the right content, context, messaging, and offers. The positive impacts have the potential to reach many areas of the business:
•	Democratize insights 
Identifying customer needs with analytics and digital behavior triggers empowers retailers to put products in front of the people most likely to buy them.
•	Grow revenue and customer lifetime value
Delivering relevant real-time offers and insights helps cross-sell products based on unified data.
•	Enhance customer loyalty 
Detecting and responding to changes in customer behavior and tailoring interactions to individual needs drives enhanced loyalty.
•	Improve marketing effectiveness 
Generating a deep understanding of customer needs and interacting with them according to their unique preferences boosts engagement.
Top challenges for personalization
Unfortunately, integrating the mechanisms required to deliver personalization into existing retail processes is complex and exposes significant challenges for many organizations:
1.	Data siloes and lack of data governance make it hard to get a 360-degree view of consumers across channels.
2.	A lack of insights acquired through AI and machine learning model development limits the ability to respond to changes in customer behavior and tailor interactions to individual needs. 
3.	Ineffective targeting of advertisements and product information negatively impacts conversion, cross-sell effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
Fully maximizing the value of modern customer engagements necessitates the integration of data created across all applications, systems, and external data signals into a single view of the customer upon which algorithms and heuristics can be applied to determine optimal actions.
How Microsoft Azure supports retailers in delivering personalization
Along with our partners, Microsoft enables retailers to overcome the challenges traditionally associated with personalization. Azure makes it possible to provide consumers with coordinated, personalized messaging and offers through their preferred channel mix and touchpoints to build deeper brand connections and extend customer lifetime value. 
Here’s how our offerings leverage and augment retail data to enhance personalization:
•	Determine data inputs 
The first step is to determine data inputs. Azure can leverage a wide variety of both structured and unstructured data, including customer data; sales/POS data; online transaction data; campaign/offer data; product data; and external data (e.g. social media).
•	Ingest data
Once inputs have been determined, leverage Azure Data Factory to ingest data, and Azure Databricks to prepare it. Ingested data is stored using Azure Data Lake Storage, a high-performance data lake available in all 54 Azure regions.
•	Accelerate insights
After data has been ingested and prepared, the Azure Synapse Analytics engine acts as a data warehouse from which data can be modeled and then served up as insights. Azure Synapse Analytics is up to 14x faster and costs 94% less than other cloud providers, enabling retailers to accelerate insights needed to support personalized offers and experiences while managing costs. The machine learning capabilities of Azure Databricks are also leveraged at this step to continuously train data and run up to 10x faster than Spark. 
•	Visualize personalized recommendations
Integrating with PowerBI enables retailers to visually surface insights as personalized recommendations and promotions that empower employees across the business to enhance customer service.
•	Discover patterns and monetize strategies
Finally, Azure’s AI and machine learning capabilities provide intelligence across massive data sets, enabling retailers to discover patterns and monetize strategies. This provides the ongoing understanding that retailers need to continuously grow revenue, enhance customer loyalty, and improve marketing campaign effectiveness.
