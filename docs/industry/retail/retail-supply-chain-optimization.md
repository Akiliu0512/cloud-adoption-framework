# Supply chain optimization in the retail industry

The speed of the clock in retail is accelerating alongside the evolution of customer demands. An astonishing 74% of consumers say they’re more likely to purchase again from a company after receiving same-day delivery of an online order. And, in the store, if a product isn’t on the shelf at the time a customer needs it, it’s become too easy to order from another retailer via their mobile phone on the spot.

Supply chain optimization is non-negotiable if retailers are to meet (and exceed) their customers’ expectations. By doing so, retailers gain visibility into the operational bottlenecks that exist between procurement, logistics, and delivery.

## Business outcomes associated with supply chain optimization

Supply chain optimization hinges on the creation of a modernized data environment that collects information from siloed sources, creates a single source of truth, and bridges the gap between systems to provide a complete picture. This visibility unlocks the power to:

- **Improving demand forecasting** Harnessing real-time analytics enables retailers to optimize labor and logistics and effectively forecast demand.
- **Driving operational changes and efficiencies** Gaining a unified view of the business makes it possible to optimize existing processes and turn operational data into actionable insights through data, analytics, and AI.
- **Reducing costs and improve customer experience** Analyzing supply chain data with analytics helps retailers put the right products in the hands of customers when they need it while reducing unnecessary inventory.
- **Increasing safety and security of goods and shipments** A modernized data environment optimizes the efficiency of the logistics journey and reduces loss by providing a complete picture of the entire supply chain where assets can be tracked.

## Top supply chain optimization challenges

Many retail organizations today have disconnected business processes and data silos that are not conducive to making informed decisions quickly, confidently, and accurately. Three key challenges stand out as particularly problematic with regards to supply chain optimization:

- They lack the infrastructure to improve inventory management and cost savings.
- They have limited visibility into key data and almost no digital feedback loop, which creates a lack of agility and responsiveness.
- They lack ability to discover and identify patterns that negatively impact the end-to-end supply chain experience.
These challenges are not insignificant, but it is possible to overcome them with the right technology solutions. 

## How Microsoft helps optimize the supply chain

Microsoft Azure’s best-in-class analytics and IoT offerings enable retailers to create a single source of truth and achieve end-to-end supply chain visibility by connecting data silos.

Microsoft’s approach to optimizing the supply chain is to layer real-time IoT insights on top of a unified view of retail data:

- **Collect and ingest data** Collect and ingest data from POS transactions, online and mobile purchases, social media, devices and IoT sensors, and supply chain or warehouse operations using Azure IoT Hub and Azure Event Hubs
- **Eliminate data silos** Store ingested data using Azure Data Lake Storage and Azure Cosmos DB to remove data silos, ensure data is always secure and available, and enable instant scalability.
- **Conduct complex data analysis** Unify a range of analytics across systems and perform complex queries on operational and transactional factory data at rapid petabyte scale using Azure Synapse Analytics. 
- **Visualize analytics outputs** Visualize analytics outputs (e.g. contract cycle optimization, available-to-promise, price elasticity analysis, route planning and scheduling, and demand forecasting) by integrating with PowerBI to increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and optimize performance.
