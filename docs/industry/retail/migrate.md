# Migrate, innovate, and modernize

## Challenges of a fast-evolving retail ecosystem

Using the [Migrate methodology](../../migrate/index.md), retailers would typically use Azure Migrate to deliver repeatable processes to migrate existing infrastructure and workloads from datacenters to public cloud. In the retail sector, this typically involves lifting and shifting infrastructure, data, and applications—moving servers, storage, networking firewalls, and security to the cloud—using IaaS solutions to reduce operational complexities, break down data silos, and harmonize data estates, and evolving to the second stage in the digital maturation continuum, [connected retail](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/industry/retail/retail-cloud-maturity#connected-retail).

But 2020 saw a substantial global increase in online purchasing of 19%, according to a [recent McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing), and multichannel fulfillment is the commonplace consumer expectation. The "digital-first" consumer journey is now market reality—shopping new brands, buying sustainable products, and choosing curbside pickup.  

This evolved, global e-commerce ecosystem, requires a heightened connection between expectations – before, during, and after purchase in this fresh consumer journey—connecting physical and digital experiences to deliver what customers want—where, when, and how they want anything. 

## New data model to meet consumer expectations

With the explosion of data in global e-commerce, it's essential for retailers to uncover insights—and deploy a unified data model that focuses on levering both structured and unstructured data to better engage with customers:

- finding ways of recognizing the customer—gathering data for online channels experiencing huge COVID growth
- gaining a 360-degree perspective on customer loyalty
- delivering seamless and consistent multichannel experiences (curbside pickup)
- humanizing the online experience with live streaming and virtual private shopping—and delivering more personalized, targeted marketing.

Meeting these challenges requires that retailers move beyond near-term innovations of the plan, buy, sell, and move retail domains of Analytics-driven retail and common data model, building on a PaaS web services development and deployment environment. For organizations to reach a fully mature iteration within the Intelligent retail model, we recommend the approach of deploying SaaS as how reimagined retail will work when deployed in its most mature state—Intelligent retail with hosted AI and ML applications and app solutions from Azure Marketplace for retail—to quickly and reliably deploy end-to-end retail solutions that will maximize your business value, while tailoring products and services to your customers.

## Large datasets and retail data

The first step towards a SaaS solution with Azure Marketplace is to understand some of the complexities of processing disparate data sources, as the retail sector moves from a reactive to a predictive data model—levering real-time data to predict future consumer behaviors—and taking proactive steps to fix issues before they disrupt operations. Fresh artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities with cloud compute can deliver these predictive insights in near-real time. 

More data has been generated in the last 3 years compared to the 30 years before—and AI and ML need a large dataset to learn from and generate high-quality predictions. The retail industry generates 40 petabytes of data an hour that can be levered to build good AI and ML models and deliver predictive insights at scale.

## Azure Retail Marketplace

A [recent study](https://clouddamcdnprodep.azureedge.net/gdc/gdc9fKC0t/original) by Forrester commissioned by Microsoft revealed that 83 percent of retail and CPG (consumer packed goods) decision makers agree that delivering a connected and unified experience to customers is vital to business success and that the key to creating those experiences lies with digital commerce.

Breaking down these silos, unifying data, and combining with AI / ML-driven insights can help retailers unlock 2-5% to line growth by meeting customer expectations across the customer journey. Your organization can advance to a SaaS solution that matures the innovative PaaS cloud-based web services development and deployment environment. Deploying AI and ML applications and apps that provide a holistic view of data, you can lever advanced data and AI capabilities to meet the ever-revolving expectations of the new e-commerce consumer on any platform, at any time—and one view of your data.

[Azure Retail Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?page=1&search=retail) is a fully digital maturation of Intelligent retail stage—a solutions portal with Azure-certifed/optimized, end-to-end solutions across the Microsoft retail partner ecosystem—offering robust AI and ML applications and apps that can help you meet the challenges of forecasting the preferences of the new retail consumer with a platform-specific—channel context-dependent, and more humanized approach to online shoppers—a digital audience whose preference is always evolving.

 ## Reimagined retail data revolution

Predicting preference in future customer behaviors is always challenging. However, you can take action towards modernizing your products, services and business models using SaaS cloud-hosted AI and ML applications and apps that provide a holistic view of data, levering their advanced data and AI capabilities.

Retailers achieving successful business outcomes are embracing digital transformation extending beyond the innovations of PaaS web services development and deployment environments to deploying SaaS AI and ML services —reimagining what retail means—implementing and building a modernized platform to maximize business value while engaging the consumer on any platform with a tailored customer experience based squarely on their preferences at the moment. 

Evolving the retail model means not only adopting the latest technologies (e.g., AI, IoT, and open APIs) to mature the Intelligent retail phase with modern SaaS AI and ML apps and services—but implementing business models of change—building in-house digital capabilities on top of these technologies for continued relevance for the consumer purchase cycle of the near future.
