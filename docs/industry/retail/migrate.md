# Migrate common Retail industry technologies

In the [Migrate methodology](../../migrate/index.md) of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, the primary tool for migration is Azure Migrate. This tool can be used to deliver a repeatable process for migrating existing infrastructure and workloads from existing data centers to the public cloud. The steps outlined in the migration methodology apply to any Retail industry migration project.

However, there are a number of additional SaaS options available to retailers which can accelerate innovation during the migration process. This article will outline considerations specific to the retail industry that may influence what & how you migrate specific workloads in the portfolio to Azure.

## Process details for the Retail industry

The migration process is heavily influenced by the target stage of maturity for any retail organization, based on the [retail cloud maturity model](./retail-cloud-maturity.md).

To move from a siloed retail to connected retail, organizations focus heavily on migration of the existing technology portfolio. In many cases, this phase of cloud adoption will focus on migrating existing workloads to an infrastructure as a service solution in Azure.

For companies who strive to achieve higher states of maturity, it could also include migrating to Office365, PowerPlatform, and Microsoft365 to replace a number of workloads that can be more effectively delivered through SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings.

## Process flow for the Retail industry

TODO: Describe the general migration flow, but ensure to also represent replace with SaaS options in the standard flow.

## Workload specific activities for the Retail industry

TODO: Are there industry specific workloads which are already in the marketplace that should be considered as additional SaaS options?
TODO: Are there common workloads in the retail industry which need to added to the list to build customer confidence? Any that the customer should be aware of that are difficult to migrate?
TODO: Are there specific criteria for workloads in that portfolio that would require the customer to run a well-architected review for any workloads?

## Next step: Innovate within the Retail industry
