# Migrate common Retail industry technologies

In the [Migrate methodology](../../migrate/index.md) of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, the primary tool for migration is Azure Migrate. This tool can be used to deliver a repeatable process for migrating existing infrastructure and workloads from existing data centers to the public cloud. The steps outlined in the migration methodology apply to any Retail industry migration project.

However, there are a number of additional SaaS options available to retailers which can accelerate innovation during the migration process. This article will outline considerations specific to the retail industry that may influence what & how you migrate specific workloads in the portfolio to Azure.

## Migration for the Retail industry

The migration process is heavily influenced by the target stage of maturity for any retail organization, based on the [retail cloud maturity model](./retail-cloud-maturity.md).

To move from a siloed retail to connected retail, organizations focus heavily on migration of the existing technology portfolio. In many cases, this phase of cloud adoption will focus on migrating existing workloads to an infrastructure as a service solution in Azure.

For companies who strive to achieve higher states of maturity, it could also include migrating to Office365, PowerPlatform, and Microsoft365 to replace a number of workloads that can be more effectively delivered through SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings.

## Microsoft Cloud for Retail

The Microsoft Cloud for Retail provides a number of fully integrated solutions for a variety of common business processes and workflows. Before migrating workloads to Azure, evaluate the following solutions to see if this SaaS-based offering can provide a more effective and cost efficient solution.

## Azure Marketplace for retail

The Azure Marketplace provides the most convenient approach to application deployment and migration for a number of common retail industry applications. Prior to migration, review the [retail industry applications in the Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?search=retail&page=1) to see if your applications are already available.

Migrating to an approved, pre-packaged deployment of your favorite applications can accelerate your migration process and significantly reduced the time required to reach the *"connected retail"* horizon.

## Standard migration process

The [Migrate methodology](../../migrate/index.md) provides a standard, repeatable process for migrating all of the technology assets from your current data centers to the cloud. Building on that repeatable process is a collection of more complex platforms and workloads that can be migrating using this process. Review the [One Migrate article](../../scenarios/index.md) to understand all of the options that can be migrated to Azure using one or more varients of the migration process.
