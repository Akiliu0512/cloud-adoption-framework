# Innovate disciplines and modernizing your organization

Building innovative practices by using data to create guided customer solutions allows you to better engage customers based on their needs. Unlocking insights into customer needs with innovative disciplines like [democratizing data](../../innovate/considerations/data) and [innovative application development](../../innovate/considerations/apps), widens efficiencies in how data is stored, analyzed, managed, and governed. Enable the move to Intelligent retail maturity by fully modernizing your organization with SaaS apps and service. Quickly and reliably provision SaaS solutions that lever AI and ML services to deliver customer insights that maximize your business value.

## Innovation in the retail industry

The [Innovate methodology](../../innovate/index.md) of the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure aligns innovation and DevOps practices to disciplines that drive ready-to-deploy, repeatable process for your organization. Open up real-time visibility into data that is understandable and accessible, and quickly synchronize with your future customers' evolving expectations in an increasingly competitive online marketplace.  Freeing up data within silos across your organization provides one view across your data—and implements unified, consistent data management practices.

Implementing accelerators that can mature your organization's move to digital maturity can increase your business value with a persistent customer conversation that drives a powerful omnichannel retail experience across platforms:

The [Retail Recommender Solution accelerator](../retail/improve-retail-experience.md) unifies data from multiple channels to deliver real-time insights by levering AI model training and development with Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Machine Learning Service—and using historical clickstream data and user events to unlock personalized interactions and preselected best offerings for your customers, with AI-native shoppers in mind.

The [Demand Forecasting Solution accelerator](../retail/retail-demand-forecasting-solution-accelerator.md) takes supply chain and sales data and turns it into–data you can make meaningful decisions with to predict or forecast outcomes, at scale, in real-time. Good data strategy and management can solve complex supply chain and sales forecasting challenges efficiently. Using Azure Machine Learning to consolidate end-to-end forecasting models, you can train data from multiple sources to forecast future demand accurately—foundational for insights into profit margin, cash flow, and capacity planning.
 
Enabling a unified, consistent view of data and unlocking a data flow that extends across silos, the Modern Finance Solution accelerator brings data from different systems together, then builds and deploys a machine learning model using Azure Synapse Analytics—identifying the top factors that can predict with increasing accuracy over time activities likely to result in higher customer revenue growth.

## Align to the retail industry maturity model

The [retail cloud maturity model](./retail-cloud-maturity.md) describes the stages of digital retail maturity. Innovation becomes critical when organizations move into the analytics-driven retail and intelligent retail stages.

One example of achieving intelligent retail maturity is the [retail recommender](./improve-retail-experience.md), which uses data, applications, analytics, and AI to enhance the retail experience.

## Democratize data

The most important step to innovation is [democratizing data](../../innovate/best-practices/data.md), because data that's accessible *and* understandable across the organization fuels innovation.

This step is accelerated through the use of a common industry-specific data model. Maintaining a common model breaks down silos that stifle communication between applications and limit data democratization. When all employees, processes, and applications operate from a common data model, they can all apply technology to improve products and services.

To extend your common data model, use cloud native tools in Azure:

- **Microsoft Power BI** to create rich visualizations and build business insights from your data models. Build and share reports and dashboards, and provide notifications, to bring the power of your data to your workforce.
- **Azure Purview** to classify and add metadata to data sources, making it easier for all users to the find the data they need.
- **Azure Data Factory** to move and transform data for use by various applications and reports.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics** for a unified data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics experience. Use Azure Synapse Analytics to ingest, explore, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.
- Other **big data** sources, such as **Hadoop**, **HDInsight**, and **Databricks**, to allow data scientists to build advanced analytics solutions from existing data.

## Engage via applications

Learn more about ways you can [build applications](../../innovate/best-practices/apps.md) to extend, improve, and automate your retail processes.

- **Power Platform** empowers citizen developers from business teams across sales, payroll, finance, and so on. Extend your common data model by empowering teams to create their own Power Apps and Power Automate solutions.
- **Intelligent experiences** build modern applications in the cloud with web apps or serverless functions. Infuse intelligence into the applications with speech, text, vision, and chat bots.

## Interact on devices

Learn more about using [device interactions](../../innovate/best-practices/devices.md) to get closer to your customers through connected devices, perhaps devices you already have.

- **Mobile experiences:** Extend customer interactions through the rapid development of mobile apps and Power Apps for mobile experiences.
- **IoT:** Collect data in near-real-time from devices in your retail, supply chain, and other environments.
