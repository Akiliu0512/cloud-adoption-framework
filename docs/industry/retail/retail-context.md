# Retail industry context

General retail context
Consumer experiences come first in the retail industry 
While impeccable customer service has always been a differentiator, customers today have additional expectations that didn’t exist a decade ago. They expect to find consistent information across different channels, from mobile apps to websites or interactions with in-store employees. They also increasingly demand personalized engagement, whether that’s product recommendations or tailored discounts. And finally, they want to have a variety of convenient ordering, delivery, and pickup options. 
Intelligent operations are a requirement
In addition to meeting customer expectations, retailers need to increase efficiency for their own employees and processes. For example, they need to make data-driven decisions in areas with small margin for error like marketing, pricing, and assortment planning. When it comes to supply chains, retailers and consumer goods companies need to handle increasing complexity and cooperate with multiple parties around the world. They need full visibility to be able to match inventory levels to demand and prevent stock-outs or overstocks. 
Harnessing technology and data to reimagine the future of retail 
To optimize operations and create stronger customer experiences, data and cloud-based services will play an indispensable role for retailers and CG companies moving forward. To stay competitive, they’ll need to connect data siloes related to customer behavior across channels, finances, supply chain, and more. With next-generation technologies like cloud computing, advanced analytics, machine learning, IoT, and mixed reality, there are endless opportunities for retailers to not only improve what they’re doing today, but to reimagine the way they do business. Cloud-based capabilities can lay the foundation for retailers to survive in the short term and thrive in the future.
COVID-19 context
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on retailers on a global scale. 
With brick-and-mortar stores either closed or limited, retailers are seeing increased demand for deliveries and returns via mail. In the U.S., grocery stores saw an over 200% spike in online in mid-March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. This trend will likely continue– in the U.S., 68% of shoppers expect to order essential goods online even after COVID-19 has subsided.
For stores that are open, flexible pick-up and check out options have become not just convenient but crucial. There’s urgent demand for frictionless experiences that keep customers and employees safe, such as curbside pick-up (BOPAC), contactless payment, and self-checkout. In a recent worldwide survey, 74% of respondents said they will continue using contactless payments after the pandemic has ended. 
On the supply side, retailers are facing supply chain and shipping challenges due to manufacturing constraints. In fact, 75% of U.S. companies experienced supply chain disruption due to the halt of production in China.
Finally, consumer preferences and purchasing patterns overall have become less predictable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 15% of consumers started shopping at different stores. Retailers will need to leverage data to find opportunities and mitigate risk.
If there is one thing to be learned following COVID-19, its that agility is the name of the game. To navigate the current crisis and become more agile and resilient in the long run, technology and data will play an important role for retailers.
