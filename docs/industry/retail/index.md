**Influence changes to individual workloads (Central IT/Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)):** As controls improve, the central IT teams will need to know the architectures that handle the workloads.

A central IT or CCoE team that supports the workload can use the guidance for insights into best practices and architectures to accelerate implementation.
