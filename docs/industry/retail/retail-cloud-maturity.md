# Cloud maturity model for Retail

The cloud is essential to remaining resilient and competitive in 21st century retail. In addition to providing a competitive advantage, cloud adoption enables cost savings, increased business agility, heightened data security, and the ability to integrate the latest in cutting-edge technology throughout the retail value chain.

The maturity model detailed in the sections that follow represent aspirational retail objectives that the right mix of cloud technologies has the potential to unlock. But cloud adoption is a process, and each transformation journey is unique.

Successfully navigating the journey requires retailers to understand their current level of cloud maturity. Consider the following four stages, for example:

## Siloed retail

Siloed retail organizations are characterized by limited to no cloud-native adoption as well as data that is underutilized and not shared across departments. While some technology is in place and employees have some digital skills, the approach taken to infrastructure, data, and applications in siloed organizations is often oriented around single locations, departments, or use cases, which creates organizational inefficiencies and inhibits innovation. This stage often represents legacy patterns and practices that must be modernized during maturity to cloud adoption.

## Connected retail

Connected retail organizations are further along on their cloud journey, having established a course forward for infrastructure, data, and applications. These organizations often start by “lifting and shifting” elements of their computing infrastructure (e.g. servers and storage, networking firewalls and security) to the cloud via Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings. This shift reduces operational complexities, breaks down data silos, and harmonizes their data estates. Retailers in this stage often leverage shared services such as item catalog availability and taxation handling and are likely to enable innovative POCs with ancillary cloud services such as artificial intelligence and internet of things (IoT) to explore new capabilities.

## Analytics-driven retail

Analytics-driven retailers are focused on establishing a foundation for future transformation via big data, IoT, and industry-specific artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The cloud groundwork that has been laid makes these retailers more data-driven and agile than retailers in earlier stages—it is in this stage that near-term innovation and actualization of the Industry Priority Scenarios detailed in the next section and use cases that are leading the retail industry (e.g. personalization, supply chain optimization, etc.) become available across all of the retail domains (Plan, Buy, Sell, Move). In this stage, many retailers will establish a new way to think about the data that drives their business. Microsoft recommends adopting a common data model that will allow 1st and 3rd party solutions to interact with the retail value chain that is represented by their data.

## Intelligent retail

Intelligent retail organizations are at the highest end of the cloud maturity spectrum. Their domains are fully-digitized and they may have started taking advantage of advanced data and AI capabilities as well as Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings to support mission-critical workloads, such as Point of Sale services and logistics operations. PaaS builds on the IaaS offerings already described to provide a complete cloud-based web services development and deployment environment with middleware, development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems, and more. These retailers are observed reinventing their organizations, maximizing their differentiated assets, and fully transforming their workforces.

The cloud migration journey can understandably seem daunting, but it doesn’t have to happen all at once. And, with the right partner and a sound strategy, cloud adoption prepares retail organizations for the next generation of technology.
