# Omnichannel optimization in the retail industry

In the retail industry, omnichannel refers to integrated channels selling goods and services that provide a coherent, captivating shopping experience for customers—regardless of the platform or device they’re using. Data is key to a business’ ability to drive such optimization across channels.

A typical retail business collects a variety of customer data, including web-browsing patterns, purchase behaviors, demographics, and other session-based web information. Some of this data originates from internal business operations, but some must be pulled from external sources such as partners, manufacturers, public domains, etc.

Business outcomes of omnichannel optimization

Retailers that can gather, prepare, reason over, and act on the data from all available sources to optimize the customer experience across channels are set up for success when it comes to:
- Increasing customer loyalty 
Driving loyalty through insights into customer behavior to deliver relevant offers at the right time brings customers back to the brand repeatedly.
- Growing revenue 
Providing seamless shopping experiences and paths to purchase in brick-and-mortar stores and digital channels is key competitive differentiator to top-line growth.
- Improving customer satisfaction 
Visibility across channels means a more customized experience. Retailers that can understand preferences and better serve customers and gain insights into crafting offers based on needs.
- Enhancing marketing effectiveness 
Marketers that leverage the analytical power of AI build smarter, more effective advertisements and campaigns that resonate with customers and maximize Marketing ROI.
Omnichannel optimization challenges
The problem for many retailers today is that they’re only able to leverage a fraction of the data available to them, which limits their ability to optimize across channels. Additionally, the integration of external, heterogeneous data sources into a shared data processing engine has traditionally required significant effort and resources to setup. 
This data integration challenge manifests itself in a few big ways across retail channels:
1.	It makes it impossible to deliver the coherent, captivating experiences customers expect.
2.	Pricing, promotion, product availability, and fulfilment strategies remain inconsistent.
3.	Customers have fragmented, irrelevant and inconsistent shopping experiences.
To overcome these challenges, retailers need a simple, scalable approach to integrating the analytics and machine learning capabilities required to predict customer purchasing activity for omni-channel optimization. 
How Microsoft enables retailers to achieve omnichannel optimization
With tools that provide visibility and a consistent experience across channels, Microsoft enables retailers to understand preferences, better serve customers, and gain insights into crafting offers based on needs. Azure is a comprehensive cloud platform with the ability to analyze massive amounts of customer data using analytics to deliver better customer experiences both online and in store.
Here’s how it works:
- Identify data inputs 
The first step is to determine data inputs. Azure can leverage data from physical and virtual retail channels as input for analytics, including on-premises customer, product, or transactional data; sales/POS data; cost-efficiency data; and workforce optimization data. 
- Enable actionable, real-time analysis
Azure Data Factory ingests data from all identified input streams so it can be processed by Azure Databricks for actionable, real-time analysis. Ingested data is stored using Azure Data Lake Storage, a high-performance data lake available in all 54 Azure regions.
- Accelerate insights
After data has been ingested and prepared, the Azure Synapse Analytics engine acts as a data warehouse from which data can be modeled and then served up as actionable insights that drive business outcomes. Azure Synapse Analytics is up to 14x faster and costs 94% less than other cloud providers, enabling retailers to accelerate insights needed to support personalized offers and experiences while managing costs. 
- Empower the entire business
PowerBI enables retailers to visualize their data in a way that democratizes insights and empowers the entire business to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, and increase customer loyalty.
- Build smarter, more effective advertisements
Finally, leveraging Azure’s AI capabilities helps retailers build smarter, more effective advertisements that resonate with audiences across channels.
