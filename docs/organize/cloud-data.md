# Cloud data functions

There are multiple audiences involved in an Analytics conversation, including the typical seller, database architect, and infrastructure team. In addition, Analytics solutions involve influencers, recommenders and decision makers from enterprise architecture, data science, business analysts, and executive leadership roles. Azure Synapse Analytics enables the entire business, from the IT stakeholder to the business analyst, to achieve more.

**DBAs/Database Architects**: Database administrators and architects are responsible for the integration and ingestion of data sources into a centralized repository, the administration and performance required for the system, and the accessibility and efficiency of query and analytic modeling against that data.

Using Azure Synapse, database administrators can match their expanding responsibilities for data warehouses and data lakes. They can use familiar languages and tools, such as T-SQL to run as many workloads as they want with ease. They can assign resources to escalate critical workloads based on intelligent workload importance, workload isolation, and enhanced concurrency capabilities.

**Infrastructure teams**: These teams deal with the provisioning and architecture of the underlying compute resources required for large analytics systems. In many cases, they are managing transitions between datacenter-based and cloud-based systems, and current needs for interoperability across both.  Typical DR as well as business continuity and high availability are common concerns.

With Azure Synapse, IT professionals can protect and manage their organization's data more efficiently. They can enable big data processing with both on-demand and provisioned compute, and secure access to cloud and hybrid configurations through tight integration with Azure Active Directory. Lastly, they can enforce privacy requirements using data masking as well as row-level and column-level security.

**Enterprise architects/Data engineers**: These teams are responsible for putting together complex solutions with components spanning integration across structured and unstructured data, transformation, storage and retrieval, analytic modeling, message-based middleware, data marts, geo-redundancy and data consistency, and dashboarding and reporting. Building effective architectures that work in an integrated manner to preserve performance, availability, ease of administration, flexibility/extensibility and actionability are key concerns for this group.

Using Azure Synapse, data engineers can simplify the steps to wrangle multiple data types from multiple sources, including streaming, transactional, and business data. They can use a code-free visual environment to easily connect to data sources and ingest, transform, and place data in the data lake.

**Data scientists**: Data scientists are in the business of understanding how to build advanced models for huge volumes of critical, yet often disparate data. Their work involves translating the needs of the business into the technology requirements for normalization and transformation of data, creation of statistical and other analytical models, and ensuring that LOB teams can easily and efficiently get the analysis they need to run the business.

Using Azure Synapse, data scientists can build proofs of concept in minutes and easily create or adjust end-to-end solutions. They can provision resources as needed or simply query existing resources on demand across massive amounts of data. Work with the language of your choiceâ€”T-SQL, R, Python, Scala, .Net, and Spark SQL.

**Business analysts**: These teams build and use dashboards, reports and other forms of data visualization to gain rapid insights required for operations. Often, each LOB will have dedicated business analysts gathering and packaging information and analytics from specialized applications, including credit cards, retail banking, commercial banking, treasury, marketing and other organizations.  

Using Azure Synapse, business analysts can securely access datasets and use Power BI to build dashboards available within Azure Synapse. They can also securely share data within and outside their organization through Azure Data Share.

**CIO/CTO/CFO/CXO**: These executives are responsible for charting strategy and ensuring strategic initiatives are implemented effectively across both IT and LOB organizations. Solutions must be cost-effective, prevent disruption to the business, allow for easy extensibility as requirements change and grow, and deliver results to the business.
