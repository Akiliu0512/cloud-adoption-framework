# Defining your cloud operating model

Cloud operating models are complex. We've seen countless customers become blocked by the minutia of details while defining their cloud operating model. It's very easy to fall into a series of circular references. To avoid circular references, the cloud adoption framework provides a series of complimentary and building methodologies that decompose the volume of decisions into smaller exercises.

## Cloud Adoption Framework alignment

To help you define the cloud operating model for your business, the cloud adoption framework breaks down each aspect of the operating model into methodologies. Each methodology and the associated actionable exercises are designed to help you define your future state operations.

![Cloud Adoption Framework methodologies](../_images/CAF-overview-new.png)

- [Strategy](../strategy/index.md): Guidance to capture business strategy and map those to efforts that can be enabled by a cloud adoption strategy.
- [Organize](../organize/index.md): Outlines the functions needed in the cloud. Also defines ways to organize people and align responsibilities.
- [Plan](../plan/index.md): Agile-based change management guidance to establish backlogs and align on-going change.
- [Manage](../manage/index.md): Align ongoing processes for operational management of the technology to maximize value attainment and minimize disruptions.
- [Govern](../govern/index.md): Ensure consistency across adoption efforts. Align to governance or compliance requirements to maintain a cross-cloud environment.
- [Security strategy](../strategy/define-security-strategy.md): Aid for defining your overall security strategy.
- [Ready](../ready/index.md): Azure landing zones provide deployment guidance and reference implementations to act on operating model decisions in the form of environmental configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ready methodology provides implementation options to Azure landing zones: Start small & expand, Start with enterprise-scale. The first option, start small, is designed to build your cloud platform, as you define each aspect of your operating model. The larger option, Enterprise-scale, builds out an enterprise ready architecture based on a number of defined operating model decisions.
