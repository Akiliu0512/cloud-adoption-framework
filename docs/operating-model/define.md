# Define your cloud operating model

Cloud operating models are complex. It's easy to fall into a series of circular references when defining your cloud operating model. To avoid circular references, the Cloud Adoption Framework provides a series of complimentary and incremental methodologies that break the large number of decisions into smaller exercises.

## Cloud Adoption Framework alignment

To help you define the cloud operating model for your business, the Cloud Adoption Framework breaks down each aspect of the operating model into methodologies. Each methodology and its actionable exercises are designed to help you define your future state operations.

### Support to develop your operating model

The following incremental methodologies are designed to help you develop your operating Cloud Adoption Framework model.

- [Manage](../manage/index.md): Align ongoing processes for operational technology management.
- [Govern](../govern/index.md): Maintain alignment with governance and compliance requirements and ensure consistency across your adoption efforts.
- [Security strategy](../strategy/define-security-strategy.md): Define your overall security strategy.
- [Organize](../organize/index.md): Outline the functions your business needs and define organizational methods for your business goals and people.

### Collective output of the operating model

Your environment should represent how your business operates. As you define your operating model, environmental readiness should align with your operations, governance, security, and organizational requirements.

- [Ready](../ready/index.md): Use deployment guidance and reference implementations from Azure landing zones to help you build your environmental configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ready methodology provides two implementation options for Azure landing zones:
>
> - **Start small and expand:** Build your cloud platform as you define each aspect of your operating model.
> - **Enterprise-scale:** Build an enterprise-ready architecture based on a set of defined operating-model decisions.

### Dependencies and inputs to operating model decisions

Business strategy and collective cloud adoption plans are inputs you should consider when defining your operating model.

- [Strategy](../strategy/index.md): Capture your business strategy and map it to your cloud adoption strategy efforts.
- [Plan](../plan/index.md): Establish backlogs and align ongoing changes using Agile-based change management.
