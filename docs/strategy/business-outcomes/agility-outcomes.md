# Examples of agility outcomes

As discussed in the [business outcomes overview](./index.md), several potential business outcomes can serve as the foundation of any conversation with the business about its transformation journey. This article focuses on the timeliest business measure: business agility. Understanding your company's market position and competitive landscape can help you articulate business outcomes that are the target of the business's transformation journey.

Traditionally, chief information officers and IT teams were considered a source of stability in core, mission-critical processes. This is still true. Few businesses can function well when their IT platform is unstable. However, in today's business world, much more is expected. IT can expand beyond a simple cost center by partnering with the business to provide market advantages. Many chief information officers and executives assume that stability is simply a baseline for IT. For these leaders, business agility is the measure of IT's contribution to the business.

The [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/845185-academy-motion-picture-arts-sciences-media-entertainment-azure) migrated its legacy web applications to the cloud to deliver new streaming applications to members in a rich, responsive, and cross-platform experience.

## Why is agility so important?

Markets change at a faster pace today than ever before. In a 2015 study that looks at turnover rate in companies' Fortune 500 status, after 61 years, only 57 companies were still on the list. This turnover rate of 88.6 percent points to an unprecedented rate of market change. IT agility, or even business agility, is unlikely to affect an organization's listing in the Fortune 500, but these numbers help us understand the pace at which markets continue to change.

For upstarts and incumbents alike, business agility can be the difference between success or failure for a business initiative. Quickly adapting to market changes can help a business ring-fence existing customers or claim market share from competitors. The agility-related outcomes in the next sections can help you communicate the value of the cloud during the transformation journey.

## Time-to-market outcome

During cloud-enabled innovation efforts, time to market is a key measure of IT's ability to address market change. In many cases, a business leader might have an existing budget to create an application or launch a new product. Clearly communicating a time-to-market benefit can motivate that leader to redirect budget to the IT transformation journey.

**Example 1:** The European division of a US-based company needs to comply with GDPR regulations by protecting customer data in a database that supports UK operations. The company division's existing version of SQL Server doesn't support the necessary row-level security. An in-place upgrade would be too disruptive. By using Azure SQL Database to replicate and upgrade the database, the customer adds the necessary compliance measure in a matter of weeks.

**Example 2:** A logistics company has discovered an untapped segment of the market. The company's largest competitor has made the same discovery. To capture the market share before its competitor, the logistics company needs a new version of its flagship application. By adopting cloud-enabled app innovation and a DevOps-driven development approach, the company embraces their customers' obsession and beat their slower, legacy competitor time to market by months. The jump on market entrance secured the customer base.

### Aurora Health Care

## Provision time

When business demands new IT services or scaling existing services, acquisition and provision of new hardware or virtual resources can take weeks. After cloud migration, IT can more easily enable self-service provisioning, allowing the business to scale in hours.

**Example:** A consumer packaged goods company requires the creation and tear-down of hundreds of database clusters per year to fulfill operational demands of the business. The on-premises virtual hosts can provision quickly, but the process of recovering virtual assets is slow and requires significant time from the team. As such, the legacy on-premises environment suffers from bloat and can seldom keep up with demand. After cloud migration, IT can more easily provide scripted self-provisioning of resources, with a chargeback approach to billing. Together, this allows the business to move as quickly as they need, but still be accountable for the cost of the resources they demand. Doing so in the cloud limits deployments to the business's budget only.
