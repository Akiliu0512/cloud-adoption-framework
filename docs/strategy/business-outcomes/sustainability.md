# Sustainability outcomes and benefits for business

Though the impact and benefits of the cloud have been traditionally measured with financial and efficiency metrics, it's become more common for customers to seek to understand how the cloud can help them to achieve their sustainability and environmental goals. Cloud computing can support your organization to reduce carbon emissions, use resources more efficiently, and lessen your environmental footprint.

Watch the following video to learn more about sustainability and how cloud migration opens the door to sustainable solutions that are good for the planet and good for your business.

Microsoft has been leading in many of these areas. The company has been operating as carbon-neutral since 2012 and has made a commitment to be carbon-negative by 2030. [The carbon benefits of cloud computing](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/3/9/739BC4AD-A855-436E-961D-9C95EB51DAF9/Microsoft_Cloud_Carbon_Study_2018.pdf), a study on the Microsoft cloud in partnership with WSP, supports research on how moving on-premises datacenters to the Microsoft cloud can significantly reduce carbon footprints.

[Bühler Group's](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/730776-buhler-group-consumer-goods-azure-iot-germany)'s IoT platform, known as Bühler Insights and powered by Azure IoT Hub, generates vital data so customers can monitor machine performance and generate accurate records for every product batch, helping food producers optimize safety, sustainability, and transparency across the supply chain.

## The Microsoft sustainability journey

The Microsoft journey started over a decade ago when the company started to apply new business practices and adopt cloud technology. We lowered our carbon emissions by 30 percent in 2009. Since then, Microsoft has made large strides forward by investing in reducing the company's carbon footprint further. Microsoft has focused on these four areas:

- **Carbon:** Cutting energy consumption across corporate offices, charging carbon tax to business divisions, and using cloud-powered technology to lower emissions.
- **Ecosystem:** Making a commitment to green datacenters and purchasing of 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours of green energy.
- **Water:** Reducing use intensity and investing in technology for managing water.
- **Waste:** Practicing responsible sourcing, recycling, and disposal; using software and technology to make buildings more efficient.

Additionally, there are four main drivers contributing to a lowered energy and carbon footprint of the Microsoft Cloud:

- **IT operational efficiency, IT equipment efficiency, and datacenter infrastructure efficiency**: reduce the energy required to deliver the services.
- **Purchase of new renewable electricity**: will power 100 percent of electricity consumed in Microsoft datacenters, buildings, and campuses by 2025.

## Building a Sustainability Strategy

Sustainability continues to gain importance as a performance indicator for organizations. As the sustainability transformation is making its mark on companies across industries, adding pressure from new types of stakeholders and challenging existing profit pools while creating opportunities to open new ones, companies are increasingly forced to respond effectively with new types of solutions and tech-enabled approaches.

This transformation is good for business. Research from multiple sources indicates that sustainability front runners have a lower cost-of-capital, deliver superior equity market returns, get easier access to new markets by creating new types of products and services, and/or are better at managing risk and ensuring more resilient operations.

Read about the [Sustainability Executive Playbook](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-Sustainability-Executive-Playbook.html)

Common considerations for building a sustainability strategy could include:

- Developing new ways of working to increase productivity
- Migrating resources to a more carbon efficient infrastructure
- Net Zero commitments
- Improving emissions recording
- Increased Operational efficiencies
- Improving societal outcomes by co-developing with partners

### Regulatory Compliance

It is your responsibility to make sure you are up to date with compliance regulations across your industry.
Consider also how government regulation and/or policy for your region might influence your organisation's motivations for migrating to the cloud.

A few governmental sustainability goals include:

- The UK Government target to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 
- The US Government target to achieve net zero by 2050 
- A European Climate Law with a 55% reduction target in greenhouse emissions by 2030 as well as the European Union target to achieve net zero by 2050

## Understanding your current emissions

As defined by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, the operational boundaries of a carbon emissions inventory are broken down into three "scopes" (both direct and indirect) of emissions data, each further broken down into distinct emission sources:

- **Scope 1:** Emissions that your organization produces directly (such as by using carbon-based fuels).
- **Scope 2:** Emissions that your organization incurs indirectly through the purchase of electricity, heat, or steam.
- **Scope 3:** Emissions that your organization incurs indirectly beyond Scope 2 emissions (for example, emissions related to your supply chain, waste disposal, business travel, and employee commuting).

You'll need a way to understand and track those scopes. 

- Read Microsoft's additional information about [Greenhouse gas emissions](https://microsoft.github.io/Sustainability-Resources/greenhouse-gas-emissions/) learn about and account for your organization's emissions.
- Read about [measuring and tracking carbon impact in the Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/sustainability/sustainability-operational-procedures#measure-and-track-carbon-impact).

## Next steps

An intentional approach can help organizations to navigate their sustainability journey. These four steps can influence outcomes for your company:

**Step 1:** Record and understand your company's carbon emissions. Start by categorizing your emissions, which will help you to list of areas on which to focus. The [Microsoft sustainability calculator](https://www.microsoft.com/sustainability/emissions-impact-dashboard) can assist you with this task.

**Step 2:** Evaluate whether your vendors, partners, and providers are taking steps to reduce their emissions and if these steps align with yours.

**Step 3:** Create an incentive for teams to reduce carbon emissions. The [Microsoft carbon fee: theory and practice](https://download.microsoft.com/documents/en-us/csr/environment/microsoft_carbon_fee_guide.pdf) guide can help your organization to drive alignment and accountability across your teams.

**Step 4:** Seek out teams in our business to enlist their support and generate ideas for areas for improvement. Build an innovation culture where individuals are participants with a sense of ownership.
