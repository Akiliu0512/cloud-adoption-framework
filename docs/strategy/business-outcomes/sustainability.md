# Examples of sustainability outcomes

Traditionally we have measured impact of cloud through financial and efficiency lenses, more and more we are beginning to see customers wanting to understand how cloud can positively affect their business in other ways such as sustainability and meeting environmental goals. Cloud computing can support you in lightening your environment footprint by reducing carbon emissions and efficiently using resources. 
Microsoft has been leading in many areas, as of 2012 we have been operating as carbon neutral and have commitments to be carbon negative by 2030. Studies show that by moving on premise datacenters to the Microsoft cloud can significantly reduce carbon footprint.

## Why is sustainability important?

Not only is focusing on sustainability key to our future by protecting the limited environmental resources, it is also good for business. Today we have the an enormous set of assets and resources at our fingertips, this enables us to expand into new areas to build innovative solutions. AGL, one of Australia's leading integrated energy companies built a solution on Azure which enables customers across the country to give back to the grid through remote management of networkd solar batteries, read the story [here](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/847171-agl-energy-azure-en-australia).

Bee'ah is a sustainability pioneer in the Middle East. They are driven by the belief that technology and sustainability are creating solutions for the future. Their ventures include waste management, environmental consulting, renewable energy and sustainable transportation. Azure have enabled them to launch the first AI platform to digitize all operations and services.

From these two examples we can see how addressing sustainability can open up new business opportunities whilst delivering against important environment goals.


## Microsoft's sustainability journey

Microsoft's journey started over a decade ago by employing new business practices and adopting cloud technology. We lowered our carbon emissions by 30% in 2009. Since then we have made large strides forward through investments in further reducing our carbon footprint. Our focus has addressed 4 areas:

- **Carbon**: cutting energy consumption across our offices, charging carbon tax to business divisions and use of cloud-enabled technology to lower emissions.
- **Ecosystem**: commitment to green datacenters and purchasing of 1.1billion kWh of green energy.
- **Water**: reduction of use intensity, technology investments in water management
- **Waste**: responsible sourcing, recycling and disposal. The use of software and technology to make buildings more efficient.

## Next steps

We need to have an intentional approach to sustainability for our organizations. To influence this business outcome there are 4 areas to review:

**Step 1**: Take note of your carbon emissions, start by categorizing your emissions. This will enable you to create a short-list of areas to focus on. Use the [sustainability calculator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/sustainability-guide/sustainability-calculator) to help do this.

**Step 2**: Evaluate vendors, partners and providers. Evaluate who you work with and whether they are taking the same steps as you to reduce emissions.

**Step 3**: Create an incentive for teams to reduce carbon usage, read [The Microsoft carbon fee: theory & practice](https://download.microsoft.com/documents/en-us/csr/environment/microsoft_carbon_fee_guide.pdf) this will help drive alignment and accountability across the organization. 

**Step 4**: Enlist the support of the teams in your business to ideate on areas for improvement. Build an innovation culture so that individuals are participants and have a sense of ownership.
