# Responsible AI

We are committed to the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven by ethical principles that put people first. We want to partner with you to support this endeavor.

## Responsible AI Principles

As you implement AI solutions, we recommend considering the following AI principles in your solution:

- Fairness: AI systems should treat all people fairly
- Reliability and safety: AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- Privacy and security: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- Inclusiveness: AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
- Transparency: AI systems should be understandable
- Accountability: People should be accountable for AI systems

## Establish a responsible AI strategy

Learn how to develop your own responsible AI strategy and principles based on the values of your organization.

## Guidelines to Develop AI responsibly

Put responsible AI into practice with these guidelines designed to help you anticipate and address potential issues throughout the software development lifecycle.

- Human-AI interaction guidelines
- Conversational AI guidelines
- Inclusive design guidelines
- AI fairness checklist
- Datasheets for datasets template
- AI security engineering guidance

## Tools for Responsible AI

Research, open source projects, and Azure Machine Learning all designed to help developers and data scientists understand, protect, and control AI systems.

- **Understand**: AI systems can behave unexpectedly for a variety of reasons. These software tools can help you understand the behavior of your AI systems, so that you can better tailor them to your needs. For example, InterpretML, Fairlearn.
- **Protect**:  AI systems rely on data. These software tools can help you protect that data by preserving privacy and ensuring confidentiality. For example, Confidential computing for ML, WhiteNoise differential privacy, SEAL homomorphic encryption, Presidio.
- **Control**:  Responsible AI needs governance and control through the development cycle. Azure Machine Learning enables an audit trail for better traceability, lineage, and control, to meet regulatory requirements. For example, Audit trail and traceability.
