# Assess your cloud adoption strategy, and enable your cloud success

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides the Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator to help you assess your overall cloud adoption strategy. This assessment makes recommendations based on the principles of cloud economics that can help your organization create a robust business case, and enable your successful cloud adoption.

## Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator

Cloud journeys are unique—and there’s often room for optimization when you start to move your organization’s services to the cloud. Whatever your situation, building solutions the right way with minimal trial and error can be challenging. There are several available cloud services and different [on-ramps to cloud adoption](../ready/landing-zone/landing-zone-journey.md). Depending on the solution you’re considering in your cloud adoption plan, there can be a dozen or more viable paths for getting started on building it. [Microsoft Assessments](https://aka.ms/adopt/assess) can make it easier to find the tailored guidance your organization needs to build or host your workloads in Azure with relevant SLAs. They help you to comprehensively assess the current state of your cloud strategy—and then close gaps on the skillsets, stakeholder support, business KPIs and budget targets that are necessary to carry out a successful cloud adoption plan.  

The [Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator](https://docs.microsoft.com/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment&id=8fefc6d5-97ac-42b3-8e97-d82701e55bab) assesses your strategy posture across distinct areas of the Strategy methodology—Identifying motivations, Documenting expected business outcomes, Evaluating financial considerations, and Technical considerations in creating a business case. Based on your responses to the assessment questions, we navigate you in detail through the categories that remain most relevant to your organization. Personalized to you, according to your inputs for each question, we provide you with an aggregate strategy score—calculated and averaged across your uniquely identified strategy areas.  

As you create your cloud adoption plan, and then document your strategy for stakeholder review, you’ll also receive curated guidance that points to specific tools and templates, along with recommendations based on principles of cloud economics and organizational alignment that provide a unified approach to build your business case.
