As you undergo your digital transformation to the cloud, it's important that you plan and develop a cloud monitoring strategy to effectively monitor and observe the behavior of applications and infrastructure services. The strategy should be growth-oriented, defined minimally, and then refined iteratively. 

The strategy should be growth-oriented, defined minimally, then refined iteratively; always aligned with business needs. Its outcome delivers an agile operations modality centered around the ability of the organization to proactively monitor complex distributed applications the business depends on.

## Terminology

This article uses the following terms and definitions:

* Service Level Agreement (SLA): 
* Service Level Objective (SLO): specify a target level for the reliability of your service
* Service Level Indicator (SLI): are the key measurements to determine the availability of a system based on the SLO defined.
* Observability: *is a qualitative indicator that a monitoring solution helps the monitoring consumer achieve the satisfactory level of control of a defined service*, where monitoring provides service consumers with a suitable range of monitoring capabilities and perspectives.

## Where to start

To ease your journey to the cloud, follow the [strategy](../strategy/index.md) and [plan](../plan/index.md) phases of the Cloud Adoption Framework. Monitoring influences and justifies the motivations and business outcomes. Include monitoring during these two phases, your initiatives, and projects. For example, examine how the first adoption project establishes early operations management in Azure. Imagine what the cloud operating model needs to look like, including the role of monitoring. Monitoring is best served with a service-based approach, as an operations function, where monitoring is an advisory service and a provider of expertise to business and IT consumers.
