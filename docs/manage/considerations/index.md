# IT management and operations in the cloud

The importance of proper management and operations can't be overstated when moving to a cloud-based model. Unfortunately, few organizations are prepared for the shift in management required to be successful in a cloud-first operating model. The theory in this section of the Cloud Adoption Framework outlines the operating model, processes, and tooling that have proven successful in the cloud. Each of these areas represent minor but fundamental shifts in the way IT operations and management should be viewed when adopting the cloud.

## Brief history of IT management

Prior to the cloud, IT management grew from a simple acquisition function. Acquisition of technical equipment to support business processes required technical expertise and deep experience with a specific group of equipment vendors. IT management consolidated the selection, acquisition, and configuration of IT assets. Generally the acquired assets included storage, computing power, networking, and other similar assets required to power the desired business function. As the primary subject matter experts on the equipment, IT was also tasked with operating the equipment to ensure maximum performance and minimal business disruptions.

When building out new technology solutions, the business has a clear need which can justify the significant expenses associated with acquiring assets, or even building out full datacenters. When building solutions, the business sees the acquisition costs as an investment in the future. Once the business need is met, the perception of the same costs shifts. Costs associated with existing solutions are seen as operational drag created by past needs. That perception is why many businesses view IT as a cost center. It is also why many IT organizations experience regular cost control exercises or reductions in IT staff.

## Cloud management

The historical IT operating model was sufficient for over 20 years. But, that model is now outdated and is less desirable than cloud-first alternatives. When moving to the cloud, IT management teams have an opportunity to rethink this model and drive greater value for the business. This article series outlines a modernized model to IT management.
