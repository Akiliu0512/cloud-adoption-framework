# Enhanced management baseline in Azure

The first three cloud management disciplines describe a management baseline. The preceding articles in this guide outlined a minimum viable product (MVP) for cloud management services, referred to as a management baseline. This article outlines a few common improvements to the baseline.

The purpose of a management baseline is to create a consistent offering that provides a minimum level of business commitment for **all*** supported workloads. This baseline of common repeatable management offerings, allows the team to deliver highly optimized operational management with minimal deviation. However, a greater commitment to the business beyond the standard offering might be needed. The following image and bullets show three ways to go beyond the management baseline.

- **Workload operations:**
  - Largest per workload operations investment.
  - Highest degree of resiliency.
  - Suggested for the approximately 20% of workloads that drive business value.
  - Typically reserved for high-criticality or mission-critical workloads.
- **Platform operations:**
  - Operations investment is spread across many workloads.
  - Resiliency improvements impact all workloads that use the defined platform.
  - Suggested for the +/-20% of the highest criticality platforms.
  - Typically reserved for medium-criticality to high-criticality workloads.
- **Enhanced management baseline:**
  - Lowest relative operations investment.
  - Slightly improved business commitments using additional cloud-native operations tools and processes.

Both workload and platform operations will require changes to design and architecture principles. Those changes could take time and may result in increased operating expenses. To reduce the number of workloads requiring such investments, an enhanced management baseline could provide enough of an improvement to the business commitment.

The following table outlines a few common processes, tools, and potential impacts common in customers' enhanced management baselines.

Azure Automation provides a centralized system for the management of automated controls. In Azure Automation, simple remediation, scale, and optimization processes can be executed in response to environmental metrics, reducing the overhead associated with manual incident processing. Most importantly, automated remediation can be delivered in near real-time, significantly reducing interruptions to business processes. A study of the most common business interruptions will identify activities within your environment that could be automated.

### Runbooks

The basic unit of code to deliver automated remediation is a runbook. Runbooks contain the instructions for remediating or recovering from an incident.

To create or manage runbooks:

1. Go to [Azure Automation](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Automation%2FAutomationAccounts).
2. Choose one of the listed **automation accounts**.
3. Find the **Process automation** section of the portal navigation.
4. The options in that section allow you to create or manage runbooks, schedules, and other automated remediation functionality.

Azure Security Center also plays an important part in your protect-and-recover strategy. It can help you monitor the security of your machines, networks, storage, data services, and applications. Azure Security Center provides advanced threat detection by using machine learning and behavioral analytics to help identify active threats targeting your Azure resources. It also provides threat protection that blocks malware or other unwanted code, and reduces the surface area exposed to brute force and other network attacks.

When Azure Security Center identifies a threat, it triggers a security alert with steps you need to take to respond to an attack. It also provides a report with information about the threat that was detected.

Azure Security Center is offered in two tiers: free and standard. Features like security recommendations are available in the free tier. The standard tier provides additional protection like advanced threat detection and protection across hybrid cloud workloads.

### Action

**Try Standard tier for free for your first 30 days.**

After you enable and configure security policies for a subscriptionâ€™s resources, you can view the security state of your resources and any issues in the **Prevention** section. You can also view a list of those issues on the **Recommendations** tile.
