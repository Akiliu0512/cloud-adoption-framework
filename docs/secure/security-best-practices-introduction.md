# Infrastructure and development security best practices

This article describes [infrastructure](infrastructure-security-overview.md) and [development](development-security-strategy-overview.md) security best practices. These prescriptive best practices and recommendations help improve the security of workloads, data, and services on Azure. 

We discuss infrastructure and development security best practices in two parts, each with its own section. These sections both cover the full lifecycle of strategy, architecture, implementation, operations, and governance. This guidance supplements Microsoft tools and security guides including the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview), [Azure Security Benchmark (ASB)](/security/benchmark/azure/introduction), and other supporting technical documentation. 

Your organization can implement ASB security controls to individual service baselines during your organization's process of benchmark planning, approval, and implementation across high level control domains: [Network security (NS)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-network-security), [Identity Management (IM)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-identity-management), [Privileged Access (PA)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access), [Data Protection (DP)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-data-protection), [Asset Management (AM)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-asset-management), [Logging and Threat Detection (LT)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v2-logging-threat-detection), [Incident Response (IR)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-incident-response), [Posture and Vulnerability Management (PV)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-posture-vulnerability-management), [Endpoint Security (ES)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-endpoint-security), [Backup and Recovery (BR)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-backup-recovery), [DevOps Security (DS)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-devops-security), and [Governance and Strategy (GS)](/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-governance-strategy).

For each topic, we provide top-level basic guidance, followed by a list and description of tools, materials, and approaches you can make use of with that guidance in mind.
