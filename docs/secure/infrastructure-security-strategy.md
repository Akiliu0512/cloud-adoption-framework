# Infrastructure security strategy

This section includes the best practices related to Infrastructure security strategy and how we recommend approaching this problem space. Advance to Infrastructure security [architecture] — Infrastructure security [implementation, operations, and governance].(add file.md#section-name).

This includes security for the common enterprise-wide elements that multiple workloads depend on, as depicted in this diagram:

We recommend starting with a proven cloud infrastructure security approach and adapting it to your business needs and initial workload deployments. Trying to start with a custom approach can quickly get you stuck in a paralysis-by-analysis loop. 

Take incremental steps to align and improve your organization and people processes but don’t plan to achieve perfection at the start. Determine what security is acceptable (often called a minimum viable product or MVP) and plan on ongoing incremental progress. Both the initial MVP and incremental progress priorities should align to established best practices and your specific business and security requirements. The adjustment you make over time will include technical implementation, processes, and people (training and readiness). 

The Cloud Adoption Framework approach to strategy includes additional considerations your organization can take to modernize strategies, architectures, and technology end-to-end on your cloud adoption path.
