# Adopt confidentiality

## Intro section

Goal: Adoption of this principle ensures that the organization can protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, maintain customer trust, and meet compliance requirements for data privacy and security. By proactively securing data, the organization reduces the risk of data breaches and builds a reputation for reliability and safety. 

## Strategy: Define business objectives that prioritize data privacy and protection

- Introduce Zero Trust
- How does MSFT support/implement ZT from a strategic standpoint? 

## Plan: Include data protection requirements in your cloud migration or development plans. 

- Landing zone intro
- Discuss other MSFT options to assist with secure migration of data and workloads

## Ready: Configure secure landing zones that enforce data access controls.

- More detail and references on Landing Zones, e.g., how to vs. conceptual. 
- Discuss Data Access Controls, Conditional Access Controls, and Role Based Access Controls Introduce in Plan, elaborate in govern.

## Adopt: Implement encryption and secure access controls  

- Continue above discussion re:  Access Controls, but in terms of adoption and enterprise institutionalization
- Introduce Encryption and MSFT provided options
- Begin developing and adopting associated standards along with the mechanisms of implementation

## Govern: Establish policies that continuously monitor and enforce data confidentiality

- Discuss policies and their useful applicability to secure data
- Introduce MSFT tools that support policy enforcement and monitoring 
- Discuss importance of well documented policies and the methods of enforcement 

## Manage: Regularly audit security measures to ensure data remains confidential.

- Discuss necessity to establish a regular drumbeat on not only monitoring, but also auditing to ensure the integrity of the policies enacted (can also serve as a good transition to the “Adopt Integrity” article) 
- Discuss importance of documenting and institutionalizing the audit procedures.
- Consider discussion of “Separation of Duties” principle, i.e., Auditors are not the policy principles, etc
- User lifecycle maintenance

## Secure: Utilize Azure's security capabilities to protect sensitive information

- Use this as an opportunity to recap many of the points brought forward above.
- Highlight MSFTs native capabilities to provide the “Confidentiality” leg of the CIA Triad
- Provide logical lead in and link to “Adopt Integrity” Article.  Reference Item (f.) above.
