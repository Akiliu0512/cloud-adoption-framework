# Adopt integrity

## Intro section

Goal: Adoption of this principle prevents data corruption, reduces errors, and supports decision-making processes. Maintaining high standards of integrity allows the organization to operate more efficiently and with greater confidence in the results produced by its data.

Integrity means that an asset is free from unauthorized alterations. Only authorized entities should be able to modify an asset, and only in specific authorized ways. For example, if you are reviewing orders placed by customers on your online store, you should not be able to increase the price of any items in those orders after they have been purchased.

Cloud environments need to ensure integrity in two general areas: data integrity and system integrity. 

Data integrity is ensured through a variety of methods including:

- **Robust data management practices** that include data validation, data verification, and use of error detection and correction algorithms to ensure accuracy and consistency of data. 
- **Access controls** are implemented to prevent unauthorized access or modification of data. 
- Regular **data backups** are performed to protect against data loss. 
- **Checksums** and **hash functions** are used to detect any unintentional changes to data. 
- **Data encryption** is used to protect data in transit and at rest, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity.
- **Database normalization** techniques reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Regular **audits** are conducted to ensure compliance with data integrity standards. 

## Strategy

Ensure data accuracy and consistency are core to business goals

## Plan 

Outline how data validation and integrity checks will be implemented

## Ready

Set up landing zones where data integrity mechanisms are built-in.

## Adopt

Use tools and processes that ensure data is not altered. 

## Govern

Implement governance frameworks that review data integrity regularly.

## Manage

Deploy monitoring tools that alert on data anomalies or alterations.

## Secure

Apply measures to prevent unauthorized data modification.
