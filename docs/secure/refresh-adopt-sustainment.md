# Adopt sustainment

## Intro section

Goal: Adoption of this principle allows the organization to maintain robust security postures, continuously optimize security operations, and respond quickly to emerging threats and technological changes.

## Strategy

Define long-term security goals for your landing zones that prioritize sustainment. This includes planning for ongoing security updates, scalability, and adaptation to evolving security threats and compliance requirements.

## Plan

Develop a detailed implementation plan that incorporates security sustainment strategies. Create a Security Review Board that continuously reviews projects and mandates security controls. Review your processes regularly to find areas of improvement. Develop processes to ensure that security is always top of mind for everyone.

## Ready 

Prepare your environment with a focus on security sustainability by choosing scalable, secure, and manageable solutions that can evolve with your organization’s needs.
 
## Adopt

- **Migrate:** Ensure that your migration strategy includes considerations for long-term security maintenance and management of cloud resources. This includes resource and enterprise level security considerations like, encryption in transit and at rest, proper access controls and continuous monitoring with a CSPM solution.
- **Innovate:**  Develop new cloud solutions with an emphasis on long-term security viability, maintainability, and compliance with future technological advancements and business requirements. Ensure that innovation does not compromise security.
- **Operate:** Ensure Security Architects are involved with all IT projects to ensure security is considered throughout the project lifecycle

## Govern

Establish governance mechanisms that include sustainment practices, ensuring that the cloud environment remains compliant and secure. Set up policies for regular security reviews, updates, and optimization of cloud services and infrastructure. Take advantage of automation and off the shelf tools to ensure continuous monitoring.

## Manage

Implement management practices that ensure the ongoing security health and performance of the cloud environment. This involves proactive security monitoring, regular updates, vulnerability assessments, and incident response plans to sustain operational security effectiveness.
