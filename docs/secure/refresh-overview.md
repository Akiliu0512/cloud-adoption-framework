# Secure overview

The CAF Secure methodology provides a structured approach for securing your Azure cloud estate. 

## The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in information security representing three core principles: [Confidentiality](./refresh-adopt-confidentiality.md), [Integrity](./refresh-adopt-integrity.md), and [Availability](./refresh-adopt-availability.md).

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. This involves implementing measures like encryption and access controls to protect data from unauthorized access.

- **Integrity:** Maintains the accuracy and completeness of data. This means protecting data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized users, ensuring that the information remains reliable.

- **Availability:** Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. This involves maintaining systems and networks to prevent downtime and ensure continuous access to data.
