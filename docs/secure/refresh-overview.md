# Secure overview

The CAF Secure methodology provides a structured approach for securing your Azure cloud estate. 

This set of guidance applies recommendations for topics across the entirety of the CAF methodologies as security must be deeply integrated in every aspect of cloud adoption.

## The CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)

The CIA Triad is a fundamental model in information security representing three core principles: [Confidentiality](./refresh-adopt-confidentiality.md), [Integrity](./refresh-adopt-integrity.md), and [Availability](./refresh-adopt-availability.md).

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. This involves implementing measures like encryption and access controls to protect data from unauthorized access.

- **Integrity:** Maintains the accuracy and completeness of data. This means protecting data from being altered or tampered with by unauthorized users, ensuring that the information remains reliable.

- **Availability:** Ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed. This involves maintaining systems and networks to prevent downtime and ensure continuous access to data.

Adopting the CIA triad helps ensure that the technology that runs your business is reliable and secure and that your operations enforce reliabilty and security through well-defined, strictly followed, and proven practices. Some of the ways the principles of the triad can help ensure security and reliability are:

- **Data protection:** The CIA Triad helps protect sensitive data from breaches, ensuring privacy and compliance with regulations.

- **Business continuity:** Ensuring data integrity and availability is critical for maintaining business operations and avoiding downtime.

- **Customer trust:** Implementing the CIA Triad builds trust with customers and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to data security.
