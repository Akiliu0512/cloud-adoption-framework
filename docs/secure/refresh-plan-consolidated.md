## General plan recommendations

- **Plan for landing zones:** The Azure landing zone approach will provide you a well-designed foundation for your cloud estate, setting you up for a manageable environment that can be secured according to best practices.

- *Landing Zones:* A landing zone is a pre-configured, secure, and scalable environment in the cloud that serves as a foundation for your workloads. It includes network topology, identity management, security, and governance components.
    
    - *Benefits:* Landing zones help standardize cloud environments, ensuring consistency and compliance with security policies. They also facilitate easier management and scalability.

- **Plan for Zero Trust adoption:** Review the [Zero Trust adoption framework](/security/zero-trust/adopt/zero-trust-adoption-overview) for thorough guidance on implementing the Zero Trust approach as you develop your cloud adoption plan. This framework is structured to align with and augment the CAF approach, helping to ensure that security is tightly integrated into your adoption journey.

## Incident preparedness and response



A key tenet of preparedness is continuous improvement. In order to be able to improve, you must first thoroughly understand your current security posture to establish your baseline and move towards finding areas for improvement. 

The [Zero trust framework modernization guide](/security/zero-trust/adopt/rapidly-modernize-security-posture#technical-plans-and-skills-readiness) offers a four-staged approach to defining your baseline and planning your continuous improvement strategies.

- **Plan for preparedness:** Plan for incident preparation by evaluating vulnerability management solutions, threat and incident detection systems and robust infrastructure monitoring solutions. Plan for infrastructure hardening to reduce attack surfaces.
