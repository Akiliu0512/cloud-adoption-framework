# Scenario Specific Enterprise Scale Landing Zones

**Enterprise-scale** is an **architecture approach and** **reference implementation** that enables effective **construction** and **operationalization** of landing zones on Azure, at scale and **aligned** with **Azure** **Roadmap** and **Microsoft** **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure**. An enterprise scale landing zone is a reference implementation of the workload environment conforming to enterprise scale architecture (opinionated way to implement, code). 

In addition to that, we have scenario specific Enterprise Scale Landing Zones that enables effective **workload** and **scenario operationalization** of landing zones on Azure, at scale and **aligned** with **Azure Roadmap** and **Microsoft** **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure**. 

These scenario specific scenarios are 

**Authoritative:** Provides holistic design decision framework for Azure Platform

**Proven:** Based on success of large-scale migration projects at-scale

**Prescriptive:** Apply it to clearly plan and design your Azure environment

Each scenario specific Enterprise Scale Landing Zone has its own relevant Architecture and its own Reference Implementation.

## Enterprise Scale for AKS

Enterprise-scale for AKS represents the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment. This solution provides an architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare landing zone subscriptions for a scalable Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Enterprise Scale for WVD

The Windows Virtual Desktop Enterprise-scale Landing zone is used after you've implemented an enterprise-scale landing zone. Enterprise-scale for WVD on Azure provide specific architectural approach and reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of WVD workload landing zones within the Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone.
