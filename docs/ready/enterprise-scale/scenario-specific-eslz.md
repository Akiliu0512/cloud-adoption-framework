# Scenario specific enterprise-scale landing zones

_Enterprise-scale_ is an architecture approach and reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale and aligned with the Azure roadmap and the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. An enterprise-scale landing zone is a reference implementation of the workload environment conforming to enterprise-scale architecture (an opinionated way to implement and code).

Additionally, we have scenario-specific enterprise-scale landing zones that enables effective workload and scenario operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale and aligned with the Azure roadmap and the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

These scenario-specific landing zones are:

**Authoritative:** Provides a holistic design decision framework for the Azure platform.

**Proven:** Based on success of large-scale migration projects deployed at scale.

**Prescriptive:** Apply it to clearly plan and design your Azure environment.

Each scenario specific enterprise-scale landing zone has its own relevant architecture and its own reference implementation.

## Enterprise-scale for AKS

Enterprise-scale for AKS represents the strategic design path and target technical state for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployment. This solution provides an architectural approach and reference implementation to prepare landing zone subscriptions for a scalable Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

Learn more about enterprise-scale for AKS in the modern application platform page.

For more information, see [Enterprise-scale for AKS](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/aks/enterprise-scale-landing-zone).

## Enterprise-scale for SAP

Enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure provides a specific architectural approach and reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of SAP workload landing zones within the Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone.

For more information, see [Enterprise-scale for SAP on Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/enterprise-scale-landing-zone).

## Enterprise-scale for Azure Virtual Desktop

The Azure Virtual Desktop enterprise-scale landing zone is used after you've implemented an enterprise-scale landing zone. Enterprise-scale for Azure Virtual Desktop provides a specific architectural approach and reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of Azure Virtual Desktop workload landing zones within the Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone.

For more information, see[Enterprise-scale for Azure Virtual Desktop](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/wvd/enterprise-scale-landing-zone).
