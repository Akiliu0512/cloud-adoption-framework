# Implementation guidelines

<<<<<<< HEAD
This section covers how to get started with the enterprise-scale platform-native reference implementation and outline design objectives.
=======
This section helps you get started with the enterprise-scale platform-native reference implementation and outline design objectives, current design, FAQ, and known issues.
>>>>>>> upstream/master

There are three categories of activities that must take place in order to implement the enterprise-scale architecture:

1. **What-must-be-true** for a the enterprise-scale
   * Encompasses activities that must be performed by the Azure and Azure AD administrators to establish an initial configuration; these are sequential by nature and primarily one-off activities.

2. **Enable a new region (_File->New->Region_)**
   * Set of activities that are required whenever there is a need to expand the enterprise-scale platform into a new Azure region.

3. **Deploy a new Landing Zone (_File->New->Landing Zone_)**
   * These are reoccurring activities that are required to instantiate a "Landing Zone"

To operationalize at scale, it is paramount that these activities follow the principal of "Infrastructure-as-Code" and automated using deployment pipelines.

## What must be true for an enterprise-scale landing zone

### Enterprise Agreement (EA) enrollment and Azure AD tenants

<<<<<<< HEAD

2. Create Department(s) â€“ Business Domains/Geo Based/Org.

3. Create an EA Account under a Department.

4. Setup Azure AD Connect for each Azure AD Tenant if identity is to be synchronized from on-premises.

5. Establish zero standing access to Azure resources and Just-in time access via Azure AD PIM.

### Management group and subscription

1. Create management group hierarchy following the recommonations in this [article](./management-group-and-subscription-organization.md#define-a-management-group-hierarchy).

2. Define an subscription provisioning criteria along with the responsibilities of a subscription Owner.

3. Create "Management", "Connectivity" and "Identity" Subscriptions for platform management, global networking as well as connectivity and identity resources (such as AD domain controllers).

5. Create custom role definitions and manage entitlements using Azure AD PIM for subscription and management group scopes.

6. Assign the Azure Policies in the table below for the Landing Zones.

## **File -&gt; new -&gt; region** and **File -&gt; New -&gt; landing zone**

### File -&gt; new -&gt; region

1. Within the connectivity subscription, create a new virtual hub within the existing Azure Virtual WAN.

2. Secure the virtual hub with Azure Firewall Manager by deploying an Azure Firewall within the virtual hub, and link existing or new firewall policies to Azure Firewall.

3. Using Azure Firewall Manager, ensure that all connected virtual networks to a secure virtual hub are protected by Azure Firewall.

4. Connect the virtual hub to on-premises using ExpressRoute or via a VPN.

5. (Optional:) Set up encryption over ExpressRoute private peering.

6. Protect virtual network traffic across virtual hubs with network security groups.

### File -&gt; new -&gt; landing zone for applications and workloads

1. Create a subscription and assign the requester as the subscription owner.

2. Assign the subscription within the management group hierarchy.

3. Set a budget and alert notifications.

4. Set up a security contact email address and phone number.

5. Create Azure AD groups for the subscription (n) owner, reader, contributor, and more.

6. Create Azure AD PIM entitlements for established Azure AD groups.

7. Provision the virtual network CIDR range if it requires virtual network connectivity.

8. Peer the virtual network with the regional virtual hub.

9. Provision required shared services (for example, domain controllers).

10. Assign required policies for the subscription scope as mandated by the policy matrix defined by organization.

\* Optional for sandbox subscriptions.

The table below provides a list of example Azure policies to enforce typical enterprise controls at a subscription scope.
