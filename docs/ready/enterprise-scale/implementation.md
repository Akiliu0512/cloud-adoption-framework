# CAF enterprise-scale landing zone implementations

> [!WARNING]
> Implementation of CAF enterprise-scale landing zone requires a clear understanding of platform, operations, and governance in the cloud. Before using any of the following implementations, all team members are advised to review the [Architecture](./architecture.md) [Design Guidelines](./design-guidelines.md).

The following implementations each deliver on the design principles and architecture defined by CAF enterprise-scale landing zone. They are also well-aligned to the broader principles of the Cloud Adoption Framework to ensure consistent integration with strategy, plan, and adopt methodologies needed at other points in the adoption lifecycle.

- **[Azure-native implementation](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar)**: The [CET-NorthStar repo](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar) on GitHub is home to one implementation of CAF enterprise-scale landing zone which leverages only native Azure tools.

- **[Terraform implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready)**: **(coming soon)** The [Cloud Adoption Framework repo](https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready) on GitHub hosts source code to implement the same architecture using terraform, an open-source tool that can be used with multiple platforms.

## Next steps

Review the [NorthStar architecture](./architecture.md)
