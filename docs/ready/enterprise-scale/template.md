# CAF Northstar Template

When various teams (internal, MSFT specific, or even partners) engage to support your cloud adoption efforts, CAF Northstar can be used as a set of reference documentation assets to communicate details regarding your environment. Rather than downloading and modifying a personal copy of the CAF NorthStar architecture, we suggest using the following document to record decisions, inputs, and deviations. These three data points will create a condensed companion guide, to describe your unique implementation of this reference platform.
