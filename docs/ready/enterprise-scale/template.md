# Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zone template

When various teams (internal, Microsoft-specific, or partners) engage to support your cloud adoption efforts, Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) enterprise-scale landing zones can be used as a set of reference documentation assets to communicate details about your environment. Rather than downloading and modifying a personal copy of the CAF enterprise-scale landing zone architecture, we suggest using the following document to record decisions, inputs, and deviations. These three data points will create a condensed companion guide to describe your unique implementation of this reference platform.
