# CAF enterprise-scale landing zone implementations

> [!WARNING]
> Implementing a cloud adoption framework (CAF) enterprise-scale landing zone requires a clear understanding of platform, operations, and governance in the cloud. Before using any of the following implementations, all team members are advised to review the [architecture](./architecture.md) [design guidelines](./design-guidelines.md). 

The following implementations deliver on the design principles and architecture defined by CAF enterprise-scale landing zone. They also aligned with the broader principles of the CAF to ensure consistent integration with strategy, plan, and adopt methodologies needed at other points in the adoption lifecycle.

- **[Azure-native implementation](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar)**: The [CAF enterprise-scale landing zone repo](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar) on GitHub is home to one implementation of CAF enterprise-scale landing zone that uses only native Azure tools.

- **[Terraform implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready)**: **(coming soon)** The [Cloud Adoption Framework repo](https://github.com/microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/tree/master/ready) on GitHub hosts source code to implement the same architecture using Terraform, an open-source tool that can be used with multiple platforms.
