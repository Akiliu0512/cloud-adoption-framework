# Getting started

This article describes how to get started with enterprise-scale reference implementation by walking you through all the prerequisites to deploy a platform-native reference implementation of enterprise-scale.
> Note: before you start, make sure that you've read and understood the overall design objective and scope of the reference implementation.

# Target audience

The target audience for this guide is people with a typical DevOps/site reliability engineering background and knowledge of Microsoft Azure Resource Manager, infrastructure as code, Git, and PowerShell.

# Contents

This article is divided into two sections:

 The first part will cover the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) for enterprise-scale reference implementation, and it will also describe how to [sync your fork with the upstream repository (repo)](./prerequisites.md#Sync-your-fork-with-upstream-repo) to update your GitHub fork with changes released in the corresponding upstream enterprise-scale [repo](https://github.com/Azure/CET-NorthStar). The second part of this article will describe how to test and [validate prerequisites](./validate-prerequisites.md) by deploying Resource Manager templates at the tenant root scope. Please note that this step is optional.
