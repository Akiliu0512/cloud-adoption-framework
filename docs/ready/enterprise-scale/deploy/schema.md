# CAF enterprise-scale template schema

This article will familiarize you with enterprise-scale template deployments, which consist of only one Microsoft Azure Resource Manager template, and provide the details of the resource(s) you may want to deploy with parameter files.

## Target audience

The target audience for this guide is people with a typical DevOps or site reliability engineering background and knowledge of Microsoft Azure Resource Manager, infrastructure as code, Git, and PowerShell.

## Contents

This article is divided in two sections. The first part will describe the [generic enterprise-scale Resource Manager template](./template-schema.md) to free you from writing your own Resource Manager templates unless you choose to. The second part of this article will explain how to deploy Resource Manager resources by updating an [enterprise-scale Resource Manager parameters file](./parameters-schema.md).
