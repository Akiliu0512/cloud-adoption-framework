# Improve landing zone governance

When a workload or the landing zones that hosts it are deployed and configured, it's important to have overall Governance of the environment.

As you're exiting the Ready state, you will have established a governance baseline for your current cloud estate. As your cloud estate evolves over time, you will have to evolve your cloud governance policies and processes. Governance is an iterative process. The govern methodology provides guidance.

Below we provide an overview of this guidance with links to the details.

## Methodology

Understand the pieces of the methodology and how they fit into the design as an ongoing exercise. Evaluate risks and create cloud governance policies to align the governance strategy of your existing deployment. For more information about the govern methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework, see [Cloud governance overview](../../govern/index.md).

## Landing zone governance best practices

The following list of guides and best practices provide examples of ways to improve landing zone governance:

- [Naming and tagging standards](../azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging.md): Ensure consistency in naming and tagging, which is the foundational data for establishing sound governance practices.

- [Track costs across workloads](../azure-best-practices/track-costs.md): Begin tracking costs in your first landing zone. Evaluate how you will apply consistency across multiple workloads and roles.

- [Scale with multiple subscriptions](../azure-best-practices/scale-subscriptions.md): Evaluate how this landing zone and other landing zones will scale, as multiple subscriptions become a requirement.

- [Organize subscriptions](../landing-zone/design-area/resource-org.md): Understand how to organize and manage multiple subscriptions.

- [Keep your Azure landing zone up to date](../../govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date.md): Why you should update your Azure landing zone environment, and how to get more information.

## Next steps

Cloud adoption will continue to expand with each wave or release of new workloads. To stay ahead of these requirements, cloud platform teams should periodically review the landing zone design areas.
