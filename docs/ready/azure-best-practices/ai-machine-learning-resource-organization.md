This article discusses decision points when creating a Workspace. When planning an Azure Machine Learning deployment for an enterprise environment, there are some common decision points or scenarios that impact how you create the Workspace. These decision points are:

* Team structure, meaning the way your Machine Learning teams are organized and collaborate on projects given use case and data segregation, or cost management requirements.
* Environments used as part of your development and release workflow to segregate development from production.
* Regionality of your data or the audience you need to serve your ML solution to.
