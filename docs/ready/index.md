# Prepare for cloud adoption

Before adoption can begin, you'll create a landing zone to host the workloads that you plan to build in or migrate to the cloud. This section of the framework guides you through environment preparation and landing zone creation.

## Landing zone concepts

[!INCLUDE [Landing zone concepts](~/../crr-aac-repo/docs/landing-zones/includes/concepts.md)]

## Landing zone journey

As you work your way through the Ready guide, consider your progress as a continuous journey that will prepare you for landing zone creation. The journey consists of 4 major phases:

- Bootstrap your environment
- Deploy Azure landing zone platform components
- Subscription vending process
- Landing zone accelerator deployment

See the graphic below for an illustration of the 4 phases, all of which will be covered in more detail as you progress through the Ready guide.

## Next steps

Continue with cloud adoption and preparing your Azure environment for landing zones, by reviewing the [Azure setup guide](./azure-setup-guide/index.md).
