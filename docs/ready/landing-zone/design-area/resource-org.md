# Design area: Resource organization

## Overview

As organizations start out on their cloud adoption journey, the scale of the starting point will vary.
Some require scale quickly in order to address business demands such as a data center migration, while others may start out with a smaller number of applications in the cloud and grow over time.

In either scenario, there should be an assumption that the environment will grow to accommodate further applications and services.

A key consideration, therefore, is how to organize resources to enable simplified management across the environment as the number of workloads increases.

In addition, as part of designing and implementing an organization's landing zone it is important to consider and decide on the foundational structure of management groups and subscriptions in order to avoid create constraints when scaling later.

The resource organization design area explores the considerations and recommendations associated with the techniques and technologies than can help maintain good structures to resource topologies within your cloud environments.
