# Design area: Management for Azure environments

For stable, ongoing operations in the cloud, a management baseline is required to provide visibility, operations compliance, and protect and recover capabilities.

## Platform management

## Application management

## Business continuity and disaster recovery

Your organization or enterprise needs to design suitable, platform-level capabilities that application workloads can consume to meet their specific requirements. Specifically, these application workloads have requirements pertaining to recover time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). Be sure that you capture disaster recovery (DR) requirements in order to design capabilities appropriately for these workloads.
