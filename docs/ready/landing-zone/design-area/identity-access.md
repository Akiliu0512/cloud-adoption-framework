# Identity and access management design area

This critical design area establishes a foundation for the management of identity and access based on best practices.

The technological landscape in the enterprise is becoming complex and heterogenous, and Identity is the primary security perimeter in a public cloud, so Identity and access management must be treated as the foundation of any secure and fully compliant public cloud architecture.

Robust identity and access management forms the basis of modern security. Authorization and access controls ensure that only authenticated users with verified devices can access and administer applications and resources. It ensures that the right individual can access the right resources at the right time, and for the right reason. It also provides reliable audit logging and nonrepudiation of user or workload identity actions.

Azure offers a comprehensive set of services, tools, and reference architectures to help organizations make highly secure and operationally efficient environments. Refer to the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/identity/identity-start-here) for guidance for designing solutions on Azure using established patterns and practices.

## Design area review

**Involved roles or functions:** Identity and access management require support from one or both of the following functions. These roles can help make decisions and implement those decisions:

- [Cloud platform](../../../organize/cloud-platform.md)
- [Cloud center of excellence](../../../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)
- [Cloud security team](../../../organize/cloud-security.md)

**Scope:** The goal of this design area is to evaluate options for your identity and access foundation. At a minimum, make decisions about your approach for synchronizing identities with Microsoft Entra ID:

- Authenticating users and workload identities
- Assigning access to resources
- Core requirements for separation of duties
- Using hybrid identities with Active Directory Domain Services domains

**Out of scope:** Identity and access management forms a foundation for proper access control. It doesn't fully address more advanced topics like:

- Zero trust
- Operational management of elevated privileges
- Automated guardrails to prevent common identity and access mistakes

These topics are addressed in the compliance design areas related to [security](./security.md) and [governance](./governance.md). Additionally, the [Azure Identity Management and access control security best practices](/azure/security/fundamentals/identity-management-best-practices) guide provides a comprehensive set of recommendations for identity and access management.

## Design area overview

Identity provides the basis for a wide variety of security assurance. It grants access based on identity authentication and authorization controls in cloud services. Access control protects data and resources and helps decide which requests should be permitted.

Identity and access management is boundary security in the public cloud. It must be treated as the foundation of any secure and fully compliant public cloud architecture.

These articles examine design considerations and recommendations related to identity and access management in a cloud environment:

- [Landing zone identity and access management](identity-access-landing-zones.md)

> [!TIP]
> If you have multiple Microsoft Entra ID tenants, review [**Azure landing zones and multiple Microsoft Entra tenants**](multi-tenant/overview.md) and its associated content.
