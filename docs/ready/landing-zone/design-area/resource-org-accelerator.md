# Azure Landing Zone accelerator configuration for resource organization

## Azure landing zone accelerator resource organization implementation

As part of the Azure landing zone accelerator the following decisions have been made and included in the implementation for management group structure:

**Top-level Management Group** (directly under the tenant root group) is created with a prefix provided by the organization, which purposely will avoid the usage of the root group to allow organizations to move existing Azure subscriptions into the hierarchy, and also enables future scenarios. This Management Group is parent to all the other Management Groups created by the Azure Landing Zone accelerator.

**Platform**: This Management Group contains all the platform child Management Groups, such as Management, Connectivity, and Identity. Common Azure Policies for the entire platform is assigned at this level

**Management**: This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for management, monitoring, and security, which will host Azure Log Analytics, Azure Automation, and Azure Sentinel. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the management subscription.

**Connectivity**: This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for connectivity, which will host the Azure networking resources required for the platform, such as Azure Virtual WAN/Virtual Network for the hub, Azure Firewall, DNS Private Zones, Express Route circuits, ExpressRoute/VPN Gateways etc among others. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the connectivity subscription.

**Identity**: This Management Group contains the dedicated subscription for identity, which is a placeholder for Windows Server Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) VMs, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services to enable AuthN/AuthZ for workloads within the landing zones. Specific Azure policies are assigned to harden and manage the resources in the identity subscription.

**Landing Zones**: This is the parent Management Group for all the landing zone subscriptions and will have workload agnostic Azure Policies assigned to ensure workloads are secure and compliant.

**Online**: This is the dedicated Management Group for Online landing zones, meaning workloads that may require direct internet inbound/outbound connectivity or also for workloads that may not require a VNet..
**Corp**: This is the dedicated Management Group for Corp landing zones, meaning workloads that requires connectivity/hybrid connectivity with the corporate network thru the hub in the connectivity subscription.
**Sandboxes**: This is the dedicated Management Group for subscriptions that will solely be used for testing and exploration by an organizationâ€™s application teams. These subscriptions will be securely disconnected from the Corp and Online landing zones.

**Decommissioned**: This is the dedicated Management Group for landing zones that are being cancelled, which then will be moved to this Management Group before deleted by Azure after 30-60 days.
