# What is a landing zone?

Cloud adoption teams launch well-architected workloads into the cloud. When your portfolio includes multiple workloads, its possible to scale and accelerate the deployment of those workloads by giving each team well-architected environments to start them down the right path. Establishing repeatable, scalable, modular environments reduces the effort required to deploy those workloads. This article series will guide the creation of these types of environments to improve cost optimization, performance efficiency, reliability, security, and operational excellence across all workloads in the portfolio.

## What are Azure landing zones

A landing zone is *the output* of a well-architected, multi-subscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security, governance, networking and IAM (Identity and Access Management). Landing zones enables application migrations and greenfield development at an enterprise scale in Azure. When the adoption team uses a landing zone, all platform resources that are required to support the customer’s portfolio have already been considered. As a result, the team can safely deploy IaaS, PaaS, or hybrid solutions with greater confidence.

A landing zone is a deployable solution that applies Azure Well-Architected  principles to enable customers to quickly create a multi-subscription Azure environment that accounts for scale, security, governance, networking and identity management. Landing zones enables application migrations and greenfield development ranging from single cloud native application to full global enterprise scale in Azure. When the adoption team uses a landing zone, all platform resources that are required to support the customer’s portfolio have already been considered, and provides a starting point for customers to evolve their environment based on their needs. As a result, the team can reduce risks and accelerate delivery by safely deploy IaaS, PaaS, or hybrid solutions with greater confidence.

We recognize that there is no one-size fits all solution to technical environments, so we ensure you have options that meet the deployment and operations needs of your growing cloud portfolio. All Azure landing zones provide a scalable, modular approach to building out your environment. Whether you are looking to deploy your first production application to Azure or are operating a complex portfolio of workloads, the landing zone templates can be tailored to your needs. Since our landing zone templates are all based on a common set of architecture design patterns you can update or reconfigure your environment at any time.

## Next steps

Before choosing the right Azure landing zone, it is important to understand the building blocks from Microsoft's [design areas for landing zones](./design-areas.md).
