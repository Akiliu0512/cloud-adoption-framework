# What is a landing zone?

Cloud adoption teams launch workloads into the cloud which should each align to the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected principles](/azure/architecture/framework/). When your portfolio includes multiple workloads, its possible to scale and accelerate the deployment of those workloads by giving each team well-architected environments (or landing zones) to start them on the right path.

## What are Azure landing zones

Azure landing zones are defined environments within a multi-subscription cloud platform that apply well-architected principles consistently across all workloads to account for scale, security, governance, networking and identity management. Consistent design areas and modular implementation options allow Azure landing zones to scale to meet your cloud adoption needs from development of your first cloud-native applications to global, enterprise-scale migrations.

When each adoption team uses an Azure landing zone, all platform resources required to support the workload have already been considered for them. Landing zone implementation options act on those considerations and give you the flexibility to start adoption with a prescriptive set of enterprise-scale design principles *or* defer specific technical decisions until your cloud operating model becomes more defined. As a result, the team can safely deploy IaaS, PaaS, or hybrid solutions with greater confidence, by clearly understanding the scope of the shared platform foundation and all of the implemented design principles.

## Next steps

Before choosing the right Azure landing zone, it is important to understand the building blocks from Microsoft's [design areas for landing zones](./design-areas.md).
