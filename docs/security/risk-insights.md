# Risk Management Insights
In order for risk management to be effective, it must be integrated into all aspects of the governance and compliance activities of an organization. In order for risks to be properly assessed, security must always be considered as part of a comprehensive approach.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the world's largest independant develpoper of international standards. Following the risk management framework published by the ISO in [31000](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:31000:ed-2:v1:en) (or similarly well-adopted frameworks by other organizations) helps ensure a non-biased approach to utilizing a framework which accurately determines risk tolerance and mitigation practices for your organization.

In earlier risk management models, security was seen as a risk modifier - adding or removing various security solutions would, in turn, increase or decrease the amount of risk mitigation for a specific item. As many recent high profile security breaches have demonstrated, security can not be treated as "just another variable" - it must be a priority and considered in all scenarios. 


## Risk management standards in information technology
Risk management in regards to information technology should be a concept which is utilized in all layers of an organization. Whether it is determining the likelihood of a physical piece of equipment failing or the potential of an external actor breaching a data source, it is critical that as you progress through your risk management journey, you start with a solid foundation.

Which standard you utilize to determine your risk may be predetermined by external factors, such as insurance or industry requirements. Public companies may be required to become [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) certified, while those in the United States Government may need to abide by the [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework). In many cases, these standardizations work in concert with each other in order to create a more robust risk managment approach.
