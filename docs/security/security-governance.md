# Governance in Security

Regardless of the number of security controls in place or whether best practices were documented and implemented, unless these practices are continuously validated and improved upon, they can quickly become outdated and insufficient.  In the framework of governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC), it is the role of governance to dictate and execute the overall security posture of a company. However, in order for the policies from the governance team to be effective, they must be enforced. Therefore, the role of senior leadership in the governance process is not only to weigh the security posture against current and future business needs and goals (as well as understanding and managing the risks inherent to each decision), but also to sanction their importance to the company by directing compliance to these policies.

In order to make informed choices on security policy, the governance team must stay informed about the current state of the environment. Mitigation data, attack rates, attack vectors, potential targets, and other threats must be communicated in a succinct and timely manner in order for the security posture implementation to remain accurate and synchronized with the security threat horizon. 

## Security governance integration

In even a small company, the amount of data produced by security incidents can be overwhelming for a singular individual - therefore governance needs to be integrated into the Information Technology (IT) organization at every step - including most, if not all, roles. While specific individuals are empowered as security leads and given the authority to make point-in-time decisions when necessary, it is the duty of all individuals to be security-minded. 

The current environment is such that a zero-day exploit can be weaponized into a deployable attack less than a day after a vulnerability patch is released. IT organizations must be able to react quickly to new threats and adapt accordingly. The speed at which a system can be guarded against an attack is often a major factor in the successful negation of an attempted breach. 

In order to maintain this agility, best practices guidance is often iterative - digesting small pieces of information from multiple sources in order to create a complete picture and continuously make small adjustments.

Examples of the information provided by the operations, monitoring, workload owners, and other teams can include: attack incidents, potential business impact, comparison to current risk management standards, as well as validation that the systems are compliant with all current security requirements. Post-mortems from attack events often contain workaround and fix implementation intelligence. With this material, the governance team is able to determine whether a change in any of the current security policies is needed.

This not only ensures that the application of best practice standards has been consistently applied across the business, but also that these standards continue to remain relevant and evolve as time moves forward.

## Continuous feedback

The overall stance and approach to risk tolerance dictates and defines the nature of the governance for a given enterprise. Compliance follows suit to demonstrate conformance to the requirements set forth by governance.
