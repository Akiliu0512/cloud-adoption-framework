# Enable customer success with a sound operating model

Often times, customer success in cloud adoption efforts has little to do with technical skills or adoption-related projects. Your operating model creates opportunities to enable adoption, or possibly roadblocks which could slow down cloud adoption.

## Blockers

When adoption of the cloud is slowed or stalled, it may be wise to evaluate your operating model to enable continued success. When success is inconsistent from workload to workload or project to project, the operating model may be misaligned. If more than one project is stalled by blocking policies, legacy processes, or misalignment of people it is likely also the operating model that is blocking success.

## Opportunities

Beyond the common blockers, there are a few key opportunities that can be scaled across the portfolio through incremental improvements to your operating model. In particular, customers commonly want to scale operational excellence, cost optimization, security, reliability, performance, or people management. Scaling these conversations at the portfolio level can help bring best practices for specific workload-focused teams to all other projects and workloads.

## Get start guides to enable teams through an operating model

The following guides will help you get started with operating model alignment and continue to improve over time.

## Shared architecture principles

The core principles of a well-managed operating model are based on a set of common architecture principles. The getting started guidance in this article series will help supporting teams, as they scale these principles across the cloud platform and throughout the portfolio of workloads.

The above principles are shared across [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-overview), [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework), and solutions in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture).

- [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-overview) evaluates the principles for individual assets across solutions, workloads, and the full portfolio.
- [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture) applies these principles to develop and manage specific technical solutions.
- [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework) helps balance these principles across a workload, to guide architecture decisions.
- [Cloud Adoption Framework](../index.yml) ensures the principles scale across the portfolio to enable adoption teams through a well-managed environment.
