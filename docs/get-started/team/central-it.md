# Get started: Align a Central IT team

When cloud adoption expands from one team to multiple teams relatively quickly, additional support from existing IT staff is needed. Those staff members might lack the training and experience required to support the cloud using cloud-native IT tools. This often drives the formation of a Central IT team governing the cloud.

> [!WARNING]
> Centralized IT should only be applied in the cloud when existing delivery on-premises is based on a centralized IT model. If the current on-premises model is based on delegated control, consider a cloud center of excellence (CCoE) approach for a more cloud-compatible alternative.

## Prerequisites

- [Break down silos and fiefdoms](../../organize/fiefdoms-silos.md): Learn about two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide the teams to productive collaboration.
- [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn): From basic overviews to deep technical training, IT staff learn how to apply Azure to their business.
- [Microsoft IT Pro Career Center](https://www.microsoft.com/itpro): A free online resource to help map your cloud career path. Learn from industry experts about your cloud role and the skills you need. Follow a learning curriculum at your own pace to build the skills that you need to stay relevant.
- We recommend that you turn your knowledge of Azure into official recognition with [Microsoft Azure certification training and exams](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/certification-overview.aspx).

## Minimum scope

In the modern view of IT, assets are globally distributed. Responsibilities are delegated. Operations management is delivered by a mixture of internal staff, managed service providers, and cloud providers. In the digital economy, IT management practices are transitioning to a model of self-service and delegated control with clear guardrails to enforce governance. A central IT team can be a valuable contributor to cloud adoption by becoming a cloud broker and a partner for innovation and business agility.

A central IT team is well positioned to draw valuable knowledge and practices from existing on-premises models and apply those practices to cloud delivery. This process requires change. New processes, new skills, and new tools are required to support cloud adoption at scale. When the central IT team adapts, it becomes an important partner in cloud adoption efforts.

## Deliverables

Adapt existing IT practices to ensure adoption efforts result in well-governed, well-managed environments in the cloud.

### Strategic tasks

- Review:
  - Business outcomes.
  - Financial models.
  - Motivations for cloud adoption.
  - Business risks.
  - Rationalization of the digital estate.
- Monitor adoption plans and progress against the prioritized migration backlog.
- Identify and prioritize platform changes that are required to support the migration backlog.
- Act as an intermediary or translation layer between cloud adoption needs and existing IT teams.
- Use existing IT teams to accelerate platform capabilities and enable adoption.

### Technical tasks

- Build and maintain the cloud platform to support solutions.
- Define and implement the platform architecture.
- Operate and manage the cloud platform.
- Continuously improve the platform.
- Keep up with new innovations in the cloud platform.
- Deliver new cloud capabilities to support business value creation.
- Suggest self-service solutions.
- Ensure that solutions meet existing governance and compliance requirements.
- Create and validate deployment of platform architecture.
- Review release plans for sources of new platform requirements.

### Team cadence

Centralized IT expertise usually comes from a working team. Expect participants to commit much of their daily schedules to alignment efforts. Contributions aren't limited to meetings and feedback cycles.

## Baseline capability

The skills needed to provide centralized IT capabilities could be provided by:

- An existing Central IT team.
- Enterprise architects.
- IT operations.
- IT governance.
- IT infrastructure.
- Networking.
- Identity.
- Virtualization.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Application owners within IT.

## What's next

As the central IT team matures its cloud capabilities, the next maturity step is typically looser coupling of cloud operations. The availability of cloud-native operations management tooling and lower operating costs for PaaS-first solutions often lead to business teams (or more specifically, DevOps teams within the business) assuming responsibility for cloud operations.
