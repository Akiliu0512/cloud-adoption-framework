# Get started: Build a cloud platform team

This guide helps you understand the goals and objectives of a platform team working on cloud adoption.

Cloud platform capabilities are usually provided by a select group of architects who focus on learning about the cloud platform. These architects then aid others in decision making and the proper application of controls to cloud environments.

## Prerequisites

- [Foundations for cloud architecture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): A Pluralsight course to help architect the right foundational solutions.
- [Microsoft Azure architecture](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/cloud-architecture-foundations): A Pluralsight course to ground architects in Azure architecture.
- [Azure network services](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-networking): Learn Azure networking basics and how to improve resiliency and reduce latency.

Review the following:

- [Business outcomes](../../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md)
- [Financial models](../../strategy/financial-models.md)
- [Motivations for cloud adoption](../../strategy/motivations.md)
- [Business risks](../../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md)
- [Rationalization of the digital estate](../../digital-estate/index.md)

## Minimum scope

Cloud platform duties center around the creation and support of your cloud platform or landing zones.

The following tasks are typically executed on a regular basis:

- Monitor adoption plans and progress against the [prioritized migration backlog](../../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/release-iteration-backlog.md).
- Identify and prioritize platform changes that are required to support the migration backlog.

### Meeting cadence

Cloud platform expertise usually comes from a working team. Expect participants to commit a large portion of their daily schedules to cloud platform work. Contributions aren't limited to meetings and feedback cycles.

## Deliverables

- Build and maintain the cloud platform to support solutions.
- Define and implement the platform architecture.
- Operate and manage the cloud platform.
- Continuously improve the platform.
- Keep up with new innovations in the cloud platform.
- Bring new cloud capabilities to support business value creation.
- Suggest self-service solutions.
- Ensure solutions meet existing governance and compliance requirements.
- Create and validate deployment of platform architecture.
- Review release plans for sources of new platform requirements.

## Baseline capability

The skills needed to provide full platform capabilities can be provided by:

- Enterprise architecture.
- IT operations.
- IT governance.
- IT infrastructure.
- Networking.
- Identity.
- Virtualization.
- Business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Application owners within IT.

## What's next

As your cloud platform becomes better defined, aligning [cloud automation](./cloud-automation.md) capabilities can accelerate adoption. It can also help establish best practices while reducing business and technical risks.

Learn to align responsibilities across teams by developing a cross-team matrix that identifies responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) parties. Download and modify the [RACI spreadsheet template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/management/raci-template.xlsx).
