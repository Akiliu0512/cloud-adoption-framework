# What's new in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Here are the recent changes we've made to the Cloud Adoption Framework.

This framework is collaboratively built with customers, partners, and internal Microsoft teams. We release new and updated content as it becomes available. New releases enable you to test, validate, and refine this guidance along with us.

Partner with us in our ongoing effort to develop the Cloud Adoption Framework.

### Security best practices for infrastructure and development

Security best practices for infrastructure and development is comprehensive guidance for the full cloud security development lifecycle across strategy, architecture, implementation, operations, and governance. These best practices complement the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, Microsoft tools, security guides, and technical documentation with a focus on infrastructure and development. They also align with the Azure Security Benchmark recommendations.

Each topic provides top-level basic guidance, followed by recommended tools, materials, and a recommended best practice approach.
