# What's new in the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

We build the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework collaboratively with our customers, partners, and internal Microsoft Teams. We release new and updated content for the framework as it becomes available. These new releases pose an opportunity for you to test, validate, and refine the Cloud Adoption Framework guidance along with us.

Partner with us in our ongoing effort to develop the Cloud Adoption Framework.

## January 2024

During the month of January, we added two articles and updated an article. 

### New articles

In [Define a sovereignty strategy](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-sovereignty-strategy), organizations that use cloud services can find guidance for meeting the sovereignty requirements for their countries/regions. We added information about sovereignty requirements in the following articles:

### Why update your Azure landing zones?

An Azure landing zone is a set of predefined Azure resources and configurations that provide a foundation for a cloud-based application or workload. It's important that your deployed landing zone environment is kept up to date so you can maintain improved security, avoid platform configuration drift, and stay optimized for new feature releases. Explore the benefits of [keeping your Azure landing zone updated, secure, and optimized](../govern/resource-consistency/keep-azure-landing-zone-up-to-date.md).

### Migrate Azure landing zone policies to Azure built-in policies

Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives might be deprecated or superseded by Azure built-in policies over time. If so, they should be removed or migrated. Explore how to [migrate Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives to Azure built-in policies](../govern/resource-consistency/migrate-azure-landing-zone-policies.md).

### Update Azure landing zone custom policies and policy initiatives
