## Shared architecture principles

The core principles of a well-managed operating model are based on a set of common architecture principles. The getting started guidance in this article series will help supporting teams, as they scale these principles across the cloud platform and throughout the portfolio of workloads.

![Shared architecture principles](../_images/shared-principles.png)

The above principles are shared across [Azure Advisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/advisor/advisor-overview), [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework), and solutions in the [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture). Azure Advisor evaluates the principles for individual resources. Azure Architecture Center applies these principles to provide well-architected solutions. Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework helps balance these principles across a workload, when making architecture decisions.

The Cloud Adoption Framework ensures a well-managed environment by applying these principles across the portfolio of workloads and the supporting environments.
