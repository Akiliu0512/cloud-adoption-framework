# Quickstart: Cloud platform team

This quickstart helps you understand the goals and objectives of a platform team working on cloud adoption.

Cloud platform capabilities are usually provided by a select group of architects who focus on learning about the cloud platform. These architects then aid others in decision making and the proper application of controls to cloud environments.

## Prerequisites

<!--- TODO --->

- (Optional) Completion of any required training. Use the language "Completion of (title)" where (title) is the link to the training.
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- First prerequisite - other methodologies that the reader should be knowledgeable about
- Second prerequisite - tools needed
- Third prerequisite

## Minimum scope

Cloud platform duties center around the creation and support of your cloud platform or landing zones.

The following tasks are typically executed on a regular basis:

- Review:
  - [business outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md)
  - [financial models](../strategy/financial-models.md)
  - [motivations for cloud adoption](../strategy/motivations.md)
  - [business risks](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md)
  - [rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/index.md)
- Monitor adoption plans and progress against the [prioritized migration backlog](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/release-iteration-backlog.md).
- Identify and prioritize platform changes that are required to support the migration backlog.

### Meeting cadence

Cloud platform expertise usually comes from a working team. Expect participants to commit a large portion of their daily schedules to cloud platform work. Contributions aren't limited to meetings and feedback cycles.

## Deliverables

- Build and maintain the cloud platform to support solutions.
- Define and implement the platform architecture.
- Operate and manage the cloud platform.
- Continuously improve the platform.
- Keep up with new innovations in the cloud platform.
- Bring new cloud capabilities to support business value creation.
- Suggest self-service solutions.
- Ensure solutions meet existing governance and compliance requirements.
- Create and validate deployment of platform architecture.
- Review release plans for sources of new platform requirements.

## Baseline capability

The skills needed to provide full platform capabilities can be provided by:

- Enterprise architecture
- IT operations
- IT governance
- IT infrastructure
- Networking
- Identity
- Virtualization
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Application owners within IT

## Out of scope

## What's next

As your cloud platform becomes better defined, aligning [cloud automation](./automation-team-quickstart.md) capabilities can accelerate adoption. It can also help establish best practices while reducing business and technical risks.
