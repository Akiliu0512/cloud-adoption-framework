# Quickstart: Cloud governance team

A cloud governance team ensure that risks and risk tolerance are properly evaluated and managed. This team ensures the proper identification of risks that can't be tolerated by the business. The people on this team convert risks into governing corporate policies.

## Prerequisites

- Review the [Governance](../govern/index.md) methodology
- Take the [Governance benchmark](../govern/benchmark.md) assessment
- [Introduction to security in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/intro-to-security-in-azure): Learn the basic concepts to protect your infrastructure and data in the cloud. Understand what responsibilities are yours and what Azure handles.
- Understand how to work across groups to [Manage cost](../organize/cost-conscious-organization.md).

## Minimum scope

- Understand [business risks](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md) introduced by the plan
- Represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md)
- Aid in the creation of a [Governance MVP](../govern/guides/index.md)

Involve the following participants in cloud governance activities:

- Leaders from middle management and direct contributors in key roles should represent the business and help evaluate risk tolerances.
- The cloud governance capabilities are delivered by an extension of the [cloud strategy team](strategy-team-quickstart.md). Just as the CIO and business leaders are expected to participate in cloud strategy capabilities, their direct reports are expected to participate in cloud governance activities.
- Business employees that are members of the business unit who work closely with the leadership of the line-of-business should be empowered to make decisions regarding corporate and technical risk.
- Information technology (IT) and information security (IS) employees who understand the technical aspects of the cloud transformation may serve in a rotating capacity instead of being a consistent provider of cloud governance capabilities.

## Deliverable

The primary duty of any cloud governance team is to balance competing forces of transformation and risk mitigation. Additionally, cloud governance ensures that the [cloud migration team](.\migration-team-quickstart.md) is aware of data and asset classification, as well as architecture guidelines that govern adoption. This team also works with the [cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md) to apply automated approaches to governing cloud environments.

### Ongoing monthly tasks

- Understand [business risks](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md) introduced during each release.
- Represent the [business's tolerance for risk](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md).
- Aid in the incremental improvement of [policy and compliance requirements](../govern/policy-compliance/index.md).

### Meeting cadence

The time commitment from each team member of the cloud governance team will represent a large percentage of their daily schedules. Contributions will not be limited to meetings and feedback cycles.

## Baseline capability

Depending on the desired business outcomes, the skills needed to provide full cloud governance capabilities include:

- IT governance
- Enterprise architecture
- Security
- IT operations
- IT infrastructure
- Networking
- Identity
- Virtualization
- Business continuity and disaster recovery
- Application owners within IT
- Finance owners

These baseline capabilities help you identify risks related to current and future releases. These efforts help you evaluate risk, understand the potential impacts, and make decisions regarding risk tolerance. When doing so, quickly update plans to reflect the changing needs of the [cloud migration team](migration-team-quickstart.md).

## Out of scope

As adoption scales, the cloud governance team may struggle to keep pace with innovations. This is especially true if your environment has heavy compliance, operations, or security requirements. If this happens you can shift some responsibilities to an existing IT team to reduce scope for the governance team.

## What's next

As cloud governance matures, teams are empowered to adopt the cloud at faster paces. Continued cloud adoption efforts tend to trigger maturity in IT operations. Either develop a cloud operations team, or sync with your cloud operations team to ensure governance is a part of operations development.

To learn more about the operations team see, [Cloud operations team](operations-team-quickstart.md).

After you've established an [initial cloud governance foundation](../govern/initial-foundation.md), use these best practices in [Governance foundation improvements](../govern/foundation-improvements.md) to get ahead of your adoption plan and prevent risks.

Learn to align responsibilities across teams by developing a cross-team matrix that identifies responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) parties. Download and modify the [RACI spreadsheet template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/management/raci-template.xlsx).
