# Quickstart guides for cloud adoption teams

Every cloud capability is provided by someone during every cloud adoption effort. These assignments and team structures can develop organically, or they can be intentionally designed to match a defined team structure. As adoption needs grow, so does the need for balance and structure. At the highest state of maturity, a cloud center of excellence aligns teams around a cloud-first modern operating model. This approach provides central IT functions like governance, security, platform, and automation.
