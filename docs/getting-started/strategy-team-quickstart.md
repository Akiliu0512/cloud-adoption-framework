# Quickstart: Cloud strategy team

Create a cloud strategy team to defined motivations and business outcomes, and to validate and maintain alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts. When the business outcomes impact business functions, the strategy team should include business leaders from across the organization. The goal of the cloud strategy team is to produce tangible business results that are enabled by cloud technologies. Overall, this team ensures that cloud adoption efforts progress in alignment with business outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn the business value of Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/learn-business-value-of-azure).
- [Learn how the Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/microsoft-cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure/): to can help you align the strategy for business, people, and technology.
- Review the [cloud adoption strategy](../strategy/index.md) process.
- Download the [strategy plan template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/readiness/Microsoft-Cloud-Adoption-Framework-Strategy-and-Plan-Template.docx).

## Minimum scope

A cloud strategy team aligns business stakeholders to maximize the business value of cloud adoption investments.

Whenever possible, business outcomes and the cloud strategy team should both be defined early in the process. As investments in cloud adoption grows and business values are realized, business stakeholders often become more engaged. When cloud adoption efforts are led by the business, the focus might be on an operating model and the organization.

### Establish the vision

- [Adoption motivations](../strategy/motivations.md): Document and articulate the reasons behind the technical effort.
- [Business outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md): Clearly articulate what's expected of the technical team in terms of business changes.
- [Learning metrics](../strategy/learning-metrics.md): Establish short-term metrics that can show progress toward longer-term business outcomes.

### Build business justification

- [Cloud migration business case](../strategy/cloud-migration-business-case.md). Establish a business case for cloud migration.

### Rationalize the digital estate

- [Incremental rationalization](../digital-estate/rationalize.md). An agile approach to rationalization that properly aligns late-bound technical decisions.
- [Rs of rationalization](../digital-estate/5-rs-of-rationalization.md). Understand the various rationalization options.

## Deliverable

The cloud strategy team drives critical prioritization and discovery efforts during cloud adoption. They may also change business processes, the execution of operations, customer interactions, or even product development. The primary focus of the cloud strategy team is to validate and maintain alignment between business priorities and cloud adoption efforts. Secondarily, this team should focus on change management across the adoption efforts. The following tasks assist in achieving this.

### Early planning tasks

- Review and provide feedback on business outcomes and financial models.
- Aid in establishing clear motivations for cloud adoption that align with corporate objectives.
- Define relevant learning metrics that clearly communicate progress toward business outcomes.
- Understand business risks introduced by the plan, represent the business's tolerance for risk.
- Review and approve the rationalization of the digital estate.

### Ongoing monthly tasks

- Support the cloud governance team during risk/tolerance conversations.
- Review release plans to understand timelines and business impact of technical change.
- Define business change plans associated with planned releases.
- Ensure business teams are ready to execute business testing and the business change plan.

### Meeting cadence

Recommendations for allocating of time for cloud strategy team members:

- During early planning efforts, allocate an hour each week to meet with the team. After the adoption plan is solidified (usually within 4–6 weeks), the time requirements can be reduced.
- Throughout the adoption efforts, allocate 1–2 hours each month to review progress and validate continued priorities.
- Additional time is likely required from delegated members of the executive's team on an as-needed basis. Each member of the cloud strategy team should appoint a delegate who can allocate 5–10 hours per week to support ongoing prioritization questions and report on any urgent needs.

## Baseline capability

The cloud strategy team should include the following:

- Finance
- Line of business
- Human resources
- Operations
- Enterprise architecture
- IT infrastructure
- Application groups
- Project managers (often with Agile project management experience)

The CEO and CIO often assign this team to drive change across various different organizations within the enterprise. In the absence of a cloud strategy team, someone must still provide these capabilities to align technical activities to business outcomes. That same person or group should also manage change across the project. Business outcomes and the cloud strategy team should both be defined early in the process.

## What's next

Strategy and planning are important. However, nothing is actionable without cloud adoption capabilities. Understand the role of this important capability before beginning adoption efforts.

Align your strategy with the cloud adoption capabilities by working with the migration team.
