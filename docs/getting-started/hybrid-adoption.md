# Getting started: Adopt in a hybrid cloud environment

A hybrid cloud solution offers the speed of cloud innovation and the control of on-premises management. These resources can help you get started with your adoption in a hybrid environment.

- [Understand hybrid networking](../decision-guides/software-defined-network/hybrid.md)
- [Create hybrid cloud consistency](../ready/considerations/hybrid-consistency.md)
- [Implement a secure hybrid network architecture in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/dmz/secure-vnet-dmz)

## Get started

Use the checklists to… Follow the steps to… This process utilizes the sections of the Cloud Adoption Framework that are highlighted in the following illustration.

Modify the baseline journey, highlighting the parts that are used in this scenario.

## Define strategy

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...

<!-- examples -->
- **Business strategy:** Are all stakeholders aligned on the motivations and expected business outcomes?
- **Business case:** Are all stakeholders aligned on the overall business justification?
- **etc:** blah?

### Step 1: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- Example - [Motivations](../strategy/motivations.md): Explanation of how this article will help them accomplish what is a necessary part of this step.
- Example - [Business Outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md): Explanation of how this article will help them accomplish what is a necessary part of this step.

Deliverable

- what is produced during this step and links to tools, templates that can be utilized.

Involved teams

- Example - Accountable team: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md)
- Example - Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Adoption Team](../organize/cloud-adoption.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Plan

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...
<!-- examples -->
- **Technical skilling**: Does the team have a skills plan in place?
- **Migration plan**: Is there a defined plan for the migration of the next 10 workloads and related assets, including clarity on people allocations?

### Step 2: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- Example - [Understand Partnership options](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/partnership-options.md) and find the best way to find the right level of partnership and support.

Deliverable

- what is produced during this step and links to tools, templates that can be utilized.

Involved teams

- Example - Accountable team: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md)
- Example - Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Adoption Team](../organize/cloud-adoption.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Ready

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...
<!-- examples -->
- **Landing zone**: Does the deployed landing zone align with the needs outlined in the adoption plan?
- **etc:** blah?

### Step 3: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- Example - [Understand Partnership options](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/partnership-options.md) and find the best way to find the right level of partnership and support.

## Adopt

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...

- **question one:** blah?
- **etc:** blah?

### Step 4: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- Example - [Understand Partnership options](../migrate/migration-considerations/assess/partnership-options.md) and find the best way to find the right level of partnership and support.

## Govern

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...

- **question one:** blah?
- **etc:** blah?
- **Example - Governance**: Is the governance team aligned with the approach to governing the cloud environment?

### Step 5: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- [Governance approach](../govern/index.md): This methodology outlines a process for thinking about corporate policy and processes. Then building the disciplines required to deliver on governance across your cloud enterprise adoption efforts.
- Example - [Initial governance foundation](../govern/guides/complex/prescriptive-guidance.md): Understand the Identity Baseline, Security Baseline, and Deployment Acceleration that are required to create a governance MVP, which will serve as the foundation for all adoption.

Deliverable

- Deploy an initial governance foundation
- Complete a governance benchmark to plan for future improvements
- Timeline risks: Improve policies and governance implementation can add 1-4 weeks per discipline

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Governance Team](../organize/cloud-governance.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Manage

Use the following check list to evaluate... Use the steps to...

- **Management**: Is there a plan for on-going operations?

### Step 6: start with a verb – e.g. do blah

Brief explanation of what this step accomplishes.

- [Management Baseline](../manage/index.md): blah…
- [Define business commitments](../manage/considerations/business-alignment.md): blah…
- [Expand the management baseline](../manage/best-practices.md): blah…
- [Get specific with advanced operations](../manage/design-principles.md): blah…

Deliverable (examples)

- Deploy a management baseline
- Complete the Ops Management Workbook
- Identify any workloads which will require an Azure Architecture Review assessment
- Timeline risks:
  - Review the workbook: 1 hour per application owner
  - Complete the Azure Architecture Review assessment: 1 hour per application

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Operations Team](../organize/cloud-operations.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)
