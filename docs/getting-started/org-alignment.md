# Align your organization

Cloud adoption can't happen without well-organized people. Successful cloud adoption is the result of properly skilled people doing the appropriate types of work, in alignment with clearly defined business goals, and in a well-managed environment. To deliver an effective cloud operating model, it's important to establish appropriately staffed organizational structures. This article outlines an approach to establishing the proper organizational structures in five steps:

1. Understand required cloud capabilities.
1. Map people to capabilities.
1. Determine team structure types.
1. Establish team structures.
1. Align RACI charts.

## Understand required cloud capabilities

The following is a list of cloud capabilities that are required to succeed at cloud adoption and longer-term operating models. After you become familiar with the various cloud capabilities, these can be aligned to organizational structures based on staffing and maturity:

- [Cloud adoption](../organize/cloud-adoption.md): Deliver technical solutions.
- [Cloud strategy](../organize/cloud-strategy.md): Align technical change to business needs.
- [Cloud operations](../organize/cloud-operations.md): Support and operate adopted solutions.
- [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md): Improve quality, speed, and resiliency of adoption.
- [Cloud governance](../organize/cloud-governance.md): Manage risk.
- [Cloud platform](../organize/cloud-platform.md): Operate and mature the platform.
- [Cloud automation](../organize/cloud-automation.md): Accelerate adoption and innovation.

## Map people to capabilities

Assuming that the suggested structure aligns to your cloud adoption plan, the next step is to map specific people to the necessary capabilities. To do so, answer the following questions:

- What person or group will be responsible for completing technical tasks in the cloud adoption plan?
- What person will be accountable for the team's ability to deliver technical changes?
- What person or group will be responsible for implementing protective governance mechanisms?
- What person will be accountable for the defining those governance controls?
- Are there other capabilities or people that will have accountability or responsibility within the cloud adoption plan?

After you've documented the answers to these questions, you can establish [plans for skills readiness](../plan/adapt-roles-skills-processes.md) to define plans to prepare these people for forthcoming work.

## Determine team structure type

The following organizational structures do not necessarily have to map to an organizational chart (org chart). Org charts generally reflect command and control management structures. Conversely, the following organizational structures are designed to capture alignment of roles and responsibilities. In an agile matrix organization, these structures may be best represented as virtual teams (or v-teams). There is no limitation suggesting that these organizational structures couldn't be represented in an org chart, but it is not necessary in order to produce an effective operating model.

The first step of managing organizational alignment is to determine how the following organizational structures will be fulfilled:

- **Org chart alignment:** Management hierarchies, manager responsibilities, and staff alignment will align to organizational structures.
- **Virtual teams (v-teams):** Management structures and org charts remain unchanged. Instead, virtual teams will be created and tasked with the required capabilities.
- **Mixed model:** More commonly, a mixture of org chart and v-team alignment will be required to deliver on transformation goals.

## Establish team structures

Every cloud capability is provided by someone during every cloud adoption effort. These assignments and team structures can develop organically, or they can be intentionally designed to match a defined team structure.

We recommend that you start with a minimum of two teams to create balance across cloud adoption efforts. These two teams are responsible for various capabilities throughout the adoption effort.

- **Cloud adoption team:** This team is accountable for technical solutions, business alignment, project management, and operations for solutions that are adopted.
- **Cloud governance team:** To balance the cloud adoption team, a cloud governance team is dedicated to ensuring excellence in the solutions that are adopted. The cloud governance team is accountable for platform maturity, platform operations, governance, and automation.

This proven approach is considered an MVP because it may not be sustainable. Each team is wearing many hats, as outlined in the [*responsible, accountable, consulted, informed* (RACI) charts](../organize/raci-alignment.md).

As adoption needs grow, so does the need to create balance and structure. To meet those needs, companies often follow a process of maturing organizational structures.

The article on [determining organizational structure maturity](../organize/organization-structures.md) provides additional detail regarding each level of maturity.

For more information about setting up additional team structures, see the [Quickstart guides for cloud adoption teams](team-roadmap-overview.md)

## Align RACI charts

At each level of maturity, accountability for various cloud capabilities shifts to new teams. This shifting of accountability enables faster migration and innovation cycles by removing and automating barriers to change. To align assignments properly, the article on [RACI alignment](../organize/raci-alignment.md) shares a RACI chart for each of the referenced organizational structures.
