# Codename: CAF NorthStar

![CAF CAF NorthStar architecture guide](./media/icon.png)

The CAF NorthStar is a journey which customers can follow to leverage the principals of the Cloud Adoption Framework to meet the specific yet common needs of a subset of cloud adoption teams.

## What is Codename: CAF NorthStar?

When navigating long distances, the North Star (Ursae Minoris or Polaris) has long been used to help travelers find true north and stay on course. Likewise, the CAF NorthStar establishes a true north (or a suggested end state) for platform architecture. This effort helps keep the iterative efforts throughout the Cloud Adoption Framework focused towards a clear destination along a linear path.

## What guidance and tools are provided in this journey?

Codename: CAF NorthStar includes four sets of assets to support cloud teams: [Implementations](./implementation.md) | [Architecture](./architecture.md) | [Design Guidelines](./design-guidelines.md) | [Template](./template.md)

- [Implementations](./implementation.md): Teams who do not yet have an existing cloud environment can leverage the full implementations to quickly deploy a well-governed cloud environment. Note: Before implementing the CAF NorthStar, readers are advised to review the architecture and road map.
- [Architecture](./architecture.md): Cloud governance teams who have an existing environment can use the  architecture as a reference when implementing best practices within their current environment.
- [Design Guidelines](./design-guidelines.md): Discovery, decisions, and implementation can require weeks or months of time to properly align requirements. The road map walks readers through the design principles and implementation guidance to keep cloud teams on a straight path during implementation.
- [Template](./template.md): Documentation template and process to quickly capture decisions and any deviation from the suggested architecture and/or implementation.

## Who should follow the guidance outlined in this journey?

This journey is designed for teams whose adoption plan calls for a mid-term objective (within 24 months) to host **more than 1,000 IaaS VMs in the cloud**. 

This journey is especially relevant for customer who also have a heightened responsibility to maintain governance, security, and operational management requirements within the cloud environment. This journey is even more relevant when workload hosting requirements are likely to require a high number of "[landing zones](../../ready/considerations/index.md)", as it will help provide a mechanism for the creation and management of new landing zones.

## Why should the defined audience follow this journey?

The Cloud Adoption Framework provides distinct methodologies to guide architectural decisions across the full cloud adoption life cycle. For most customers, cloud governance, cloud management, cloud platform, and cloud adoption teams will each mature at their own pace to deliver on the company's digital transformation strategy. For most teams that maturity is an ongoing, iterative process of identifying and addressing opportunities to learn and improve.

For companies to be successful in the large scale adoption efforts described above require all platform, governance, and management to reach a minimum level of maturity in unison and early in the lifecycle. Codename CAF NorthStar pulls forward and adds to each methodology in the form of a single, united implementation. This implementation of a common architecture ensures that specific standards are met across all landing zones.

## Community

This guide is developed largely by **Microsoft Cloud Solutions Architects and the broader Cloud Solutions Unit technical community**. This community actively advances this guide to share lessons learned during enterprise-scale adoption efforts.

While this guide shares the same design principles as the standard Ready methodology, it expands upon those principles to integrate topics like governance and security, earlier in the planning process. This expansion of the standard process is necessary because of a few natural assumptions that can be made when an adoption effort requires large-scale enterprise change.
