# CAF NorthStar implementations

> [!WARNING]
> Implementation of CAF NorthStar requires a clear understanding of platform, operations, and governance in the cloud. Before using any of the following implementations, all team members are advised to review the [road map](./roadmap.md).

The following implementations each deliver on the design principles and architecture defined by CAF NorthStar. They are also well-aligned to the broader principles of the Cloud Adoption Framework to ensure consistent integration with strategy, plan, and adopt methodologies needed at other points in the adoption lifecycle.

- Azure-native implementation: The ___ Github repo is home to an implementation of CAF NorthStar which leverages only native Azure tools.
- Terraform implementation: The ___ Github repo hosts source code to implement the same architecture using terraform, an open-source tool that can be used with multiple platforms.
- Additional implementations: (coming soon) There are many ways to implement the core architecture for CAF NorthStar. There are also many ways to define various types of landing zones which could be used with CAF NorthStar.

> [!WARNING]
> Before using any of the above approaches to implementation, the [implementation guide](./implementation-guide.md) should be reviewed with all involved team members.

## Next steps

Review the [NorthStar architecture](./northstar-architecture.md)
