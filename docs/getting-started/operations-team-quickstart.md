# Quickstart: Cloud operations team

An operations team focuses on monitoring, repairing, and the remediation of issues related to traditional IT operations and assets. In the cloud, many of the capital costs and operations activities are transferred to the cloud provider, giving IT operations the opportunity to improve and provide significant additional value.

## Prerequisites

- [Create an Azure account](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/create-an-azure-account): The first step to using Azure is to create an account. Your account holds the Azure services that you provision and handles your personal settings, like identity, billing, and preferences.
- [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/tour-azure-portal): Tour the Azure portal features and services, and customize the portal.
- [Azure fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/azure-for-the-data-engineer): Learn cloud concepts, understand the benefits, compare and contrast basic strategies, and explore the breadth of services available in Azure.

## Minimum scope

<!-- TODO -->

Include a sentence or two to explain only the minimum scope for the team.

Use bullet or numbered list of tasks that may be required within this scope.

## Deliverable

The duties of the people on the cloud operations team involve delivering maximum workload performance and minimum business interruptions within an agreed-upon operations budget.

### Strategic tasks

- Review:
  - [Business outcomes](../strategy/business-outcomes/index.md)
  - [Financial models](../strategy/financial-models.md)
  - [Motivations for cloud adoption](../strategy/motivations.md)
  - [Business risks](../govern/policy-compliance/risk-tolerance.md)
  - [Rationalization of the digital estate](../digital-estate/index.md)
- Determine workload criticality, impact of disruptions, or performance degradation.
- Establish business-approved cost and performance commitments.
- Monitor and operate cloud workloads.

### Technical tasks

- Maintain asset and workload inventory.
- Monitor performance of workloads.
- Maintain operational compliance.
- Protect workloads and associated assets.
- Recover assets if there is performance degradation or business interruption.
- Mature capabilities of core platforms.
- Continuously improve workload performance.
- Improve budgetary and design requirements of workloads to fit commitments to the business.

### Meeting cadence

The cloud operations team should be involved in release planning and cloud center of excellence planning to provide feedback and prepare for operational requirements.

## Baseline capability

The skills needed to provide cloud operations capabilities can be provided by:

- IT operations
- Outsource IT operations vendors
- Cloud service providers
- Cloud-managed service providers
- Application-specific operations teams
- Business application operations teams
- DevOps teams

## Out of scope

## What's next

As adoption and operations scale, it's important to define and automate governance best practices that extend existing IT requirements. Forming a [cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md) is an important step to scaling cloud adoption, cloud operations, and cloud governance efforts.
