# Getting started: Build in the cloud

Creating new products and services in the cloud requires a different approach than migration. The innovate methodology in the Cloud Adoption Framework establishes an approach that guides the development of new products and services.

## Get started

Innovation isn't the right adoption path for every workload. An innovation path typically requires a larger investment in custom code and data management than other paths. Innovation also takes longer than migration or other forms of modernization. This process utilizes the sections of the Cloud Adoption Framework that are highlighted in the following illustration.

Modify the baseline journey, highlighting the parts that are used in this scenario.  

![Getting Started with title](../_images/getting-started/ caf-baseline-journey.png)

## Define strategy

Use the migration checklists to discover opportunities and gaps in your innovation strategy. Use the steps to understand and categorize motivations and business outcomes.

- **Motivations:** Are all stakeholders aligned on the motivations and expected business outcomes?

Common motivations include:

- Preparing for new technical capabilities
- Scaling to meet market demands
- Scaling to meet geographic demands
- Building new technical capabilities
- Improving customer experiences and engagements
- Transforming products or services
- Disrupting the market with new products or services

### Step 1: Understand motivations

To avoid common innovation blockers, create a clear and concise business strategy for your innovation efforts.

- [Motivations](../strategy/motivations.md): The first step to strategic alignment is to gain a consensus on the motivations driving this effort. Start by understanding and categorizing motivations and common themes from various stakeholders across business and IT.

Deliverable

- Use the [Strategy and Planning Template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/readiness/Microsoft-Cloud-Adoption-Framework-Strategy-and-Plan-Template.docx) to record motivations and desired business outcomes.

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Adoption Team](../organize/cloud-adoption.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

### Step 2: Define business value

Invest the necessary time in defining the business value created from your innovation efforts.

- [Business value](../innovate/business-value.md): Once motivations are aligned, define how innovations drive business value.

The following questions can help you define business value:

- What is the defined customer need that you seek to address with this solution?
- What opportunities would this solution create for your business?
- Which business outcomes would be achieved with this solution?
- Which of your company's motivations would be served with this solution?

Deliverable

- Use the [Strategy and Planning Template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/readiness/Microsoft-Cloud-Adoption-Framework-Strategy-and-Plan-Template.docx) to record motivations and desired business value.

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Adoption Team](../organize/cloud-adoption.md)

## Plan

Use the following information to examine and align skills and resources.

- **Technical skilling**: Does the team have a skills plan in place?
- **Resources**: Is there a defined plan for innovation efforts, including clarity on people allocations?

### Step 3: Org and skills planning

Success is enabled thru properly skilled people doing the appropriate types of work, in alignment with clearly defined business goals, and in a well-managed environment.

- [Initial organization alignment](../organize/index.md): An overview of alignment and team structures to help meet specific goals.
- [Break down silos and fiefdoms](../organize/fiefdoms-silos.md): Learn about two common organizational antipatterns and ways to guide the teams to productive collaboration.

Deliverable

- Use the [RACI spreadsheet template](https://archcenter.blob.core.windows.net/cdn/fusion/management/raci-template.xlsx) to identify responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) parties.

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Adopt

Use the following evaluate readiness and accelerate deployment of innovative solutions.

- **Innovation:** Is the cloud adoption team ready to build new technical and business capabilities?

### Step 4: Use the right tools and processes

Use the Azure innovation guide to accelerate the deployment of innovative solutions, by understanding the tools and processes that can help you create a minimum viable product (MVP).

- [Azure Innovate guide](../innovate/innovation-guide/index.md): A starting point for innovation guidance in the Cloud Adoption Framework.
- [Overview of the Azure toolchain](../innovate/best-practices/index.md): Learn how to combine Azure services to create a toolchain for digital invention.

Deliverable

- Custom-built applications
- Technology-based experiences
- Integration of physical products and technology using IoT
- Ambient intelligence: Integration of nonintrusive technology into an environment
- Cognitive Services: Big Data, AI, Machine Learning, and predictive solutions

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Adoption Team](../organize/cloud-adoption.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Govern

Use the following to evaluate policy and compliance, identify gaps and build disciplines required to govern innovations in the cloud.

- **Governance**: Is the governance team ready to govern these new cloud innovations?

### Step 5: Improve governance foundation for new innovations

Understand governance gaps and define corporate policy needed to ensure business value and avoid risk.

- [Governance approach](../govern/index.md): This methodology outlines a process for thinking about corporate policy and processes. Then building the disciplines required to deliver on governance across your cloud enterprise efforts.
- [Define corporate policy[(../govern/corporate-policy.md)]: Identify and mitigate business risks.

Deliverable

- Complete a governance benchmark to identify gaps and ensure governance policies are in place
- Timeline risks: Improve policies and governance implementation can add 1-4 weeks per discipline

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Governance Team](../organize/cloud-governance.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Manage

Use the following to evaluate your plan and ensure stable operations.

- **Management**: Is there a plan for on-going operations?

### Step 6: Expand and advance operations

Ensure ongoing, stable operations of the technology assets deployed to the cloud.

- [Expand the management baseline](../manage/best-practices.md): This section of the Cloud Adoption Framework guides you through various transitions into operational management in the cloud.
- [Get specific with advanced operations](../manage/design-principles.md): Discover ways to go beyond your management baseline.

Deliverable

- Identify any workloads which will require an [Azure Architecture Review assessment](https://docs.microsoft.com/assessments/?id=azure-architecture-review)
- Review the Well Architected Framework for deeper guidance during innovation.

Involved teams

- Accountable team: [Cloud Operations Team](../organize/cloud-operations.md)
- Responsible/Supporting teams: [Cloud Strategy Team](../organize/cloud-strategy.md) and [Cloud center of excellence](../organize/cloud-center-of-excellence.md)/[Central IT](../organize/central-it.md)

## Value statement

The steps outlined in this getting started guide can help you and your teams create innovative solutions in the cloud that create business value, are governed appropriately, and are well architected.

## What's next

Continue your innovation journey using the [innovate methodology](../innovate/index.md).
