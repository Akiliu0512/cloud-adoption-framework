# Innovation through cloud adoption in the Cloud Adoption Framework

Cloud migration is an excellent option for the workloads that already exist in an environment. Creating new products and services requires a different approach. The innovate methodology within this framework establishes an approach to guide the development of new products and services.

## Motivations behind innovation

Innovation should not be the chosen adoption path for all workloads. This path to cloud adoption often requires a larger investment in custom code and data management. Innovation also takes inherently longer than migration, or even many forms of modernization. However, this path is suggested when customers are targeting the following types of business outcomes:

- Prepare for new technical capabilities
- Scale to meet market demands
- Scale to meet geographic demands
- Build new technical capabilities
- Improve customer experiences / engagements
- Transform products or services
- Disrupt the market with new products or services

## Common workload examples associated with a cloud innovation

- Custom-built applications.
- Technology-based experiences.
- IoT: Integration of physical products and technology.
- Ambient intelligence: Integration of nonintrusive technology into an environment.
- Cognitive Services: Big Data, AI, Machine Learning, and predictive solutions.
