# Azure Virtual Datacenter

Azure Virtual Datacenter has been integrated into the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. This guidance serves as a significant part of the foundation for the [Ready methodology](../ready/index.md) and the [Govern methodology](../govern/index.md) within the Cloud Adoption Framework. To support customers making this transition, the following resources have been archived and will be maintained in a separate GitHub repository.

**Archived resources:**

- [Azure Virtual Datacenter ebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/archive/vdc/Azure_Virtual_Datacenter.pdf): This e-book shows you how to deploy enterprise workloads to the Azure cloud platform, while respecting your existing security and networking policies.
- [The virtual datacenter: A network perspective](./networking-vdc.md): This overview of networking patterns and designs addresses the architectural scale, performance, and security concerns that customers face when planning a large-scale cloud migration.
- [Azure Virtual Datacenter Lift and Shift Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/CloudAdoptionFramework/master/archive/vdc/Azure_Virtual_Datacenter_Lift_and_Shift_Guide.pdf): This white paper discusses the process that enterprise IT staff and decision makers can use to identify and plan the migration of applications and servers to Azure using a lift and shift approach, minimizing any additional development costs while optimizing cloud hosting options.
