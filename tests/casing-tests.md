# role-based access control

- [Azure AD Connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity). The Azure AD Connect tool allows you to connect Azure AD instances with your existing identity management solutions, allowing synchronization of your existing directory in the cloud.
- [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview). Azure AD provides RBAC to efficiently and securely manage access to resources in the management plane. Jobs and responsibilities are organized into roles, and users are assigned to these roles. RBAC allows you to control who has access to a resource along with which actions a user can perform on that resource.
