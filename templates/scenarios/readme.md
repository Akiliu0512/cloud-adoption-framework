# Template for new tech platform scenarios

The files in this folder are designed to start a new tech platform scenario with minimum necessary requirements in place.

## CAF work to finalize the scenarios

- For each ESLZ page, the headers & metadata need to look more like the same file in the AKS scenario
- CAF team to review the articles & identify any additional requirements for each page
- CAF team to review the articles for quality to ensure we don't start with known errors
- CAF team to update the Ready article to match AKS scenario flow

## ThinkTank team steps to use this template

1. Change the name of the folder from "<Insert Scenario Name>" to the approved scenario folder name
2. Find & replace across all files <In VSCode Ctl+Shift+H> to replace instances of "<Insert Scenario Name>" with the approved name for the scenario
3. All scenario articles (not prefixed with ESLZ-) must accurately reflect the CAF methodologies AND the marketing motion to drive this scenario. Each starts with a series of sections that must be evaluated & populated based on CAF links in each section.
4. Add as many additional H2 sections after the core CAF sections as required to tell the story & guide adoption.
5. Codename: "Construction sets" are often at a different scope than the parent scenario. The name of those assets will likely match a hero technology, instead of the business problem reflected in the scenario name. Perform a similar Find & replace across all files <In VSCode Ctl+Shift+H> to replace instances of <Insert ESLZ Scenario Name> with the name of the "Construction set".
6. Update the Enterprise-Scale-Landing-Zone.md file to reflect the demonstrated architecture & link to the actionable deployment
7. Populate all remaining ESLZ articles (prefixed with ESLZ) to reflect any considerations or recommendations required to prepare for the ESLZ deployment. Any additional guidance may be added after the H2's for recommendations & considerations.
